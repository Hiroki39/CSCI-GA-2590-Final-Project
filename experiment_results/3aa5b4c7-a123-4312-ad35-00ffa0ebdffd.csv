0,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?A)5(√3 + 1), B)6(√3 + √2), C)7(√3 – 1), D)8(√3 – 2), E)None of these",A,"Let the height of the tower be h and the distance between the car and the base of the tower be x. Then we have:

tan(45°) = h/x
tan(60°) = h/(x + vt)  (where v is the speed of the car and t is the additional time it takes to reach the base of the tower)

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

x + vt = h/√3

We can also use the fact that the car is traveling at a uniform speed to relate x and t:

x = vt

Substituting x in the first equation, we get:

tan(45°) = h/vt

Simplifying, we get:

v = h/t

Substituting v in the second equation, we get:

t(1 + √3) = h/√3

Solving for t, we get:

t = h/(3 + √3)

To find the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, we need to substitute h with xtan(45°) and simplify:

t = xtan(45°)/(3 + √3)
t = x(1)/(3 + √3)
t = x(3 - √3)

Substituting x = vt, we get:

t = v(3 - √3)t

Simplifying, we get:

t = 6(√3 + √2)

Therefore, the answer is B) 6(√3 + √2).",,2.0,1
1,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?A)$61, B)$65, C)$67.40, D)$70, E)$78.20",E,"Let's call the original price of the item ""x"". 

After the 22% discount, the price becomes 0.78x. 

Then, the customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the price becomes 0.78x - 20. 

We know that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so we can set up the equation: 

0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

0.28x = 21.90 

x = 78.20 

Therefore, the original price of the item was $78.20. 

The answer is E.",,78.2,1

So:

P(neither A nor B) = 1 - P(A or B)

To find the probability that at least one of the events will occur, we can use the formula:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

where P(A and B) is the probability that both events occur. We don't have this information, but we can find an upper bound for it by assuming that the events are independent (which may not be true, but it gives us a conservative estimate). In that case:

P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.56 × 0.74 = 0.4144

So:

P(neither A nor B) = 1 - (0.56 + 0.74 - 0.4144) = 1 - 0.8856 = 0.1144

The greatest value for this probability among the answer choices is 0.26, so the answer is B.",,0.26,1

5,"20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?A)40, B)200, C)380, D)400, E)3200",D,"Since all 20 marbles pulled out the first time were painted black and put back in, the bag now contains 20 more black marbles than it did originally. Let's call the original number of marbles in the bag ""x"". Then, after the first 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, the bag contained x+20 marbles, of which x were white and 20 were black. 

When the second set of 20 marbles was pulled out, only 1 was black. This means that the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/20, or 5%. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 

(20+20)/(x+20) = 5/100 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

40/(x+20) = 1/20 

Multiplying both sides by 20(x+20), we get: 

800 = x+20 

So the bag currently holds x = 780 marbles. But we need to add the 20 black marbles that were painted and put back in, so the total number of marbles in the bag is Q = 780 + 20 = 800.

After covering a quarter of the distance (250 miles), the train has 750 miles left to cover. At a speed of 75 miles/hour, it will take the train 750/75 = 10 hours to cover the remaining distance. Therefore, the total journey duration is 10 + 10 = 20 hours. However, we need to add the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour, which is 250/100 = 2.5 hours.

16,"Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?A)1 step/minute, B)2 step/minute, C)3 step/minute, D)4 step/minute, E)None of the above",A,"Let's assume that the total number of steps in the staircase is ""x"". 
From the first statement, we can write:
(x/20) * 20 + 10 = x
Simplifying this, we get:
x + 200 = 20x
19x = 200
x = 10.53 (approx.)
From the second statement, we can write:
(x/10) * 20 = x
Simplifying this, we get:
x = 20
So, the actual number of steps in the staircase is 20. 
Now, we can calculate the speed of the elevator:
If we walk 20 steps and stop, we cover 20 steps in 10 minutes. So, our speed is:
20/10 = 2 steps/minute
Similarly, if we walk 10 steps and stop, we cover 10 steps in 20 minutes. So, our speed is:
10/20 = 0.5 steps/minute
The elevator covers the remaining steps at a speed of:
2 - 0.5 = 1.5 steps/minute
Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 1.5 steps/minute.

We don't know the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last 12 months, but we know the average was 42 for the entire last year. So the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last 12 months was 42*12 = 504. 

Therefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the 22 months period is X = 200 + 504 = 704.

(H + L)/2 = x

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

H + L = 2x

We also know that the average score for the entire class is y. Let S be the sum of all the scores in the class. Then we have:

S/z = y

Multiplying both sides by z, we get:

S = yz

Now, to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to find the sum of all the scores excluding H and L, and divide by the number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers, which is z - 2.

The sum of all the scores excluding H and L is S - H - L. Substituting the values we know, we get:

S - H - L = yz - H - L

We can rewrite this as:

S - H - L = (yz - 2x) + (2x - H - L)

The first term on the right-hand side is the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers, and the second term is the sum of the highest and lowest scores. Dividing the first term by z - 2, we get the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers:

If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?A)12, B)16, C)24, D)30, E)40",C,"Let's start by finding the cost price of each bag of flour. If the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, then the cost price must be 75% of the selling price. 

75% of $100 = $75 

So the cost price of each bag of flour is $75. 

Now we can use the profit to find how many bags were sold: 

$3,000 profit ÷ $25 profit per bag = 120 bags 

So the grocer sold 120 bags of flour. 

However, the answer choices don't include 120, so we need to adjust for the fact that the question is asking for the closest answer choice. 

If the grocer sold 120 bags, the total revenue would be: 

120 bags × $100 per bag = $12,000 

The profit would be: 

$12,000 revenue - $9,000 cost = $3,000 

So the closest answer choice is 12 bags, which would give a revenue of: 

12 bags × $100 per bag = $1,200 

And a profit of: 

$1,200 revenue - $900 cost = $300

average speed = total distance / total time

Since the plane is flying around a square, each side has the same distance. Let's call the length of each side ""d"". Then the total distance around the square is 4d.

To find the total time, we need to know how long it takes the plane to fly each side. We can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

So the time it takes to fly each side is:

time1 = d / 200
time2 = d / 400
time3 = d / 600
time4 = d / 800

The total time is the sum of these four times:

total time = time1 + time2 + time3 + time4

Now we can substitute in the formulas and simplify:

total time = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800
total time = (12d + 6d + 4d + 3d) / 2400
total time = 25d / 2400

Finally, we can substitute the total distance and total time into the formula for average speed:

average speed = total distance / total time
average speed = 4d / (25d/2400)
average speed = 384 km/hr

So the answer is A) 384.",,384.0,1

Then, the total cost of 18 sharpeners can be expressed as:
9x + 9(x+1) = 100
Simplifying this equation, we get:
18x + 9 = 100
18x = 91
x = 5.06 (rounded to two decimal places)
So, the cost of one brown sharpener is approximately Rs. 5.06 and the cost of one white sharpener is approximately Rs. 6.06.
To find out how many of each type of sharpener Jack bought, we can use trial and error or algebra. One possible method is:
Let the number of brown sharpeners be b and the number of white sharpeners be w.
Then, we have two equations:
b + w = 18 (because Jack bought a total of 18 sharpeners)
bx + wy = 100 (because the total cost of the sharpeners is Rs. 100)
Substituting x = 5.06 and y = 6.06, we get:
b + w = 18
5.06b + 6.06w = 100
Multiplying the first equation by 5.06 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get:
0.06w = 25.08
w = 418 (rounded to the nearest whole number)
Substituting w = 8 in the first equation, we get:

We know that:

- In 1 hour, hose A can fill 1/8 of the pool (since it takes 8 hours to fill the whole pool)
- In 1 hour, working together, hoses A and B can fill 1/5 of the pool (since they finish the pool in 3 hours after hose A fills 2 hours alone)

Using this information, we can set up two equations:

2a + 3(a+b) = 1 (since they fill the whole pool in 5 hours total)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
5a + 3b = 1/8

And we also know that:
b = (1/5 - a) (since we know that together they can fill 1/5 of the pool, and we already know hose A's rate)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
5a + 3(1/5 - a) = 1/8
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2a = 1/24
a = 1/48

Now we can use the second equation to solve for b:
b = (1/5 - 1/48) = 47/240

Finally, we can use the rate of hose B to figure out how long it would take to fill the whole pool:
b = 1/t
t = 240/47

Then, the number of students who are members of the swim team (including those who are also in the chess club) is (24 + x).

We know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. So, 80% of members of the swim team are also members of the chess club. We can set up an equation:

A) 47: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 47 is 235. When we divide this by 10, we get 23.5, which is not a perfect square.

B) 91: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 91 is 455. When we divide this by 10, we get 45.5, which is not a perfect square.

C) 41: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 41 is 205. When we divide this by 10, we get 20.5, which is not a perfect square.

D) 67: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 67 is 335. When we divide this by 10, we get 33.5, which is not a perfect square.

E) 44: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 44 is 225. When we divide this by 10, we get 22.5, which is not a perfect square.

None of the answer choices work! But we can still solve the problem by using algebra. We know that the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is 5x + 20, and we want this to be a perfect square when divided by 10. So we can write:

(5x + 20)/10 = k^2

where k is some integer. Simplifying, we get:

x + 4 = 2k^2

This tells us that x+4 must be an even perfect square (since 2k^2 is always even). The only two-digit even perfect squares are 16, 36, 64, and 100. Trying each of these, we find that only 36 works:

x+4 = 36
x = 32

So the five consecutive odd numbers are 32, 34, 36, 38, and 40. The answer is not one of the answer choices given.",,40.0,1

The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?A)8, B)10, C)12, D)15, E)19",B,"Let's start by figuring out how many cakes each helper can make in 3 hours. If a helper can make 2 large cakes in an hour, then they can make 6 large cakes in 3 hours. Similarly, if a helper can make 35 small cakes in an hour, then they can make 1050 small cakes in 3 hours.

We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, which is equivalent to 350 small cakes (since 1 large cake = 35 small cakes). So we need a total of 370 cakes (20 large + 350 small).

Let's assume we need x helpers. Each helper can make 6 large cakes in 3 hours, so x helpers can make 6x large cakes in 3 hours. Similarly, each helper can make 1050 small cakes in 3 hours, so x helpers can make 1050x small cakes in 3 hours.

We want to find the value of x that satisfies the following equation:

6x + 1050x = 370

Simplifying this equation, we get:

1056x = 370

x = 370/1056

x ≈ 0.35

Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need at least 1 helper.

- One helper can make 6 large cakes and 1050 small cakes in 3 hours.
- 6 large cakes = 210 small cakes (since 1 large cake = 35 small cakes).
- So one helper can make a total of 1260 small cakes in 3 hours.
- We need 370 cakes in total, which is equivalent to 12.57 helpers (370/29.4).
- Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to 13 helpers.

Simplifying this equation, we get:

So the least possible number of students in the school is 501. However, the answer choices don't include 501, so we have to look for the next possible value. If we try x = 550, we get:

0.2(550) + 0.28(550) - (the number of students who took both physics and math) = 154

The number of students who took both physics and math can't be more than 110 (which is the smaller of 0.2x and 0.28x), so we have:

0.2(550) + 0.28(550) - (110) = 44

91,"The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be :A)Rs.1560, B)Rs.1680, C)Rs.1840, D)Rs.1950, E)Rs.1690",B,"We can set up two equations using the given information:
1800 = a + 540b
2040 = a + 620b
where a is the fixed part of the bill and b is the cost per call.
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
240 = 80b
b = 3
Substituting b = 3 into either equation, we get:
a = 1260
So the equation for the bill is:
Bill = 1260 + 3(number of calls)
When 500 calls are consumed, the bill would be:
Bill = 1260 + 3(500) = Rs. 2760
However, we are told that the number of calls consumed is due to more holidays, which suggests that the fixed part of the bill may decrease. So we need to adjust our answer accordingly. One way to do this is to assume that the fixed part of the bill is proportional to the number of days in the month, and then use the ratio of days to adjust the fixed part. For example, if the month with 540 calls had 30 days and the month with 500 calls had 28 days, then we can adjust the fixed part as follows:
New fixed part = 1260 x (28/30) = 1176
So the adjusted bill would be:
Bill = 1176 + 3(500) = Rs. 2166

We know that:

- The cost of x Sunday newspapers is 4x dollars
- The cost of 6y newspapers (one for each day of the week except Sunday) is 6y dollars
- The hotel orders twice as many Sunday newspapers as the rest of the week, so x = 2y
- The total cost for the week is 210 dollars, so 4x + 6y = 210

We can use the fact that x = 2y to substitute for x in the second equation:

4(2y) + 6y = 210
8y + 6y = 210
14y = 210
y = 15

So the hotel orders 15 newspapers on each of the other days of the week. To find out how many newspapers it buys on Monday, we just need to add up the number of newspapers ordered on Monday and the number ordered on Sunday:

x = 2y = 2(15) = 30

x = (120*7)/4 = 210 

So the total number of sweets is 210. 

Since the ratio of red sweets to the total number of sweets is 3:7, we can find the number of red sweets by setting up another proportion:

Then, 75% of them (75 employees) take a winter vacation, 40% of them (40 employees) take both winter and summer vacations, and 20% of them (20 employees) take neither vacation. 

To find the number of employees who take only a summer vacation, we can use the formula:

Total employees who take summer vacation - Employees who take both vacations = Employees who take only summer vacation

Let's represent the number of employees who take only a summer vacation with ""x"". Then:

100% - 20% = 80% take at least one vacation
80% - 75% = 5% take only a summer vacation
40 = 75 - 5 + 20 + x
x = 40 - 75 + 5 + 20
x = -10

This doesn't make sense - we can't have negative employees! So we made a mistake somewhere. Looking back at our calculations, we see that we assumed there were 100 employees in the company, but we don't actually know the total number of employees. 

Let's represent the total number of employees with ""T"". Then:

75% of T take a winter vacation = 0.75T
40% of T take both vacations = 0.4T
20% of T take neither vacation = 0.2T
100% - 20% = 80% take at least one vacation = 0.8T

To find the number of employees who take only a summer vacation, we can use the formula:

Total employees who take summer vacation - Employees who take both vacations = Employees who take only summer vacation

Let's represent the number of employees who take only a summer vacation with ""x"". Then:

0.8T - 0.75T = 5% of T take only a summer vacation = 0.05T
0.4T = 0.75T - 0.05T + 0.2T + x
0.4T = 0.9T + x
x = -0.5T

Again, this doesn't make sense - we can't have negative employees! So we made another mistake somewhere. Looking back at our calculations, we see that we assumed that the employees who take both vacations are included in the employees who take a winter vacation. But this is not necessarily true - some of the employees who take both vacations may not take a winter vacation. 

Let's represent the number of employees who take both vacations with ""y"". Then:

75% of T take a winter vacation = 0.75T
40% of T take both vacations = y
20% of T take neither vacation = 0.2T
100% - 20% = 80% take at least one vacation = 0.8T

To find the number of employees who take only a summer vacation, we can use the formula:

Total employees who take summer vacation - Employees who take both vacations = Employees who take only summer vacation

Let's represent the number of employees who take only a summer vacation with ""x"". Then:

0.8T - 0.75T = 5% of T take only a summer vacation = 0.05T
y + x = 0.4T
0.2T = 0.75T - y + x
0.2T = 0.35T + x - y

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can solve for ""x"" by eliminating ""y"" from the last two equations:

0.2T = 0.35T + x - y
y = 0.35T + x - 0.2T
y = 0.15T + x

Substituting this into the second equation:

y + x = 0.4T
(0.15T + x) + x = 0.4T
2x = 0.1T
x = 0.05T

So 5% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. The answer is (A) 5%.",,5.0,0

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we know that the number of boys in the group is 4x and the number of girls is 3x. 

Before the new members joined, there were already 64 boys and 40 girls in the group, so the total number of members was 64 + 40 = 104. 

After the new members joined, the number of boys increased by x and the number of girls increased by x as well. So the total number of boys in the group became 4x + x = 5x, and the total number of girls became 3x + x = 4x. 

The total number of members in the group is now 5x + 4x = 9x. We don't know what x is, but we can set up an equation based on the fact that the total number of members increased by x:

ABC - 495 = CBA

Adding 495 to both sides, we get:

For alloy X:
- The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3.
- This means that out of every 2+3=5 parts of the alloy, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper.
- So in 40 grams of alloy X, there are (2/5)*40=16 grams of zinc and (3/5)*40=24 grams of copper.

For alloy Y:
- The ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify.
- This means that out of every 7+11=18 parts of the alloy, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper.
- So in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (7/18)*60=23.33 grams of zinc and (11/18)*60=36.67 grams of copper.

Now we can add the amounts of zinc and copper in the two alloys to find the ratio in alloy Z:
- Total zinc in alloy Z = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams
- Total copper in alloy Z = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams

Let's try to simplify the equation above:

We know that x and y are both integers, so we need to find two integers that satisfy the equation above. 
One way to do this is to start with y = 0 and keep increasing it until we find a valid solution. 
If y = 0, then 4x = 68, which means x = 17. This is not a valid solution because the diver needs to bring at least one brass coin to earn some money. 
If y = 1, then 4x + 5 = 68, which means 4x = 63 and x = 15.75. This is not a valid solution because x needs to be an integer. 
If y = 2, then 4x + 10 = 68, which means 4x = 58 and x = 14.5. This is not a valid solution because x needs to be an integer. 
If y = 3, then 4x + 15 = 68, which means 4x = 53 and x = 13.25. This is not a valid solution because x needs to be an integer.

At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?A)1 hr 23 min, B)1 hr 15 min, C)1 hr 8 min, D)56 min, E)55 min",D,"Let's assume that the two trains meet x hours after Train N leaves City B. Then, Train M would have been traveling for (x+4) hours (since it left 4 hours earlier than Train N). We know that the distance between City A and City B is the same for both trains, so we can set up the equation:

Distance traveled by Train M = Distance traveled by Train N
(speed of Train M) x (time traveled by Train M) = (speed of Train N) x (time traveled by Train N)

We can also use the formula distance = speed x time to express the distances in terms of the speeds and times:

(speed of Train M) x (x+4) = (speed of Train N) x (x)

We don't know the speeds of the trains, but we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the speed of Train N:

(speed of Train M) / (speed of Train N) = x / (x+4)

We can also use the given times to express the times in terms of x:

(time traveled by Train M) = x+4
(time traveled by Train N) = 3.5 - x

We know that the two trains meet when they have traveled the same distance, so we can set up another equation:

(distance traveled by Train M) = (distance traveled by Train N)

(speed of Train M) x (time traveled by Train M) = (speed of Train N) x (time traveled by Train N)

Substituting the expressions for the times and simplifying, we get:

(speed of Train M) x (x+4) = (speed of Train N) x (3.5 - x)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns (the speeds of the trains and the time x), so we can solve for x. First, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by (speed of Train N):

(speed of Train M) / (speed of Train N) = (3.5 - x) / (x+4)

Then, we can substitute the expression for (speed of Train M) / (speed of Train N) from the previous equation:

x / (x+4) = (3.5 - x) / (x+4)

Multiplying both sides by (x+4), we get:

x = 1.23 hours

So the two trains meet 1 hour and 23 minutes after Train N leaves City B. To find the exact time, we can add this to the departure time of Train N:

7:00 am + 1 hour 23 minutes = 8:23 am

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1 hr 23 min.",,23.0,1

The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, so the total area to be papered is (17.5x-15)*0.5 = 8.25x. The cost of papering this area is (8.25x*2)/100 = 0.165x. So we have:

45.665x = 260
x = 5.7

k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51

- Sand: 30% of 10kg = 3kg
- Clay: 70% of 10kg = 7kg

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay, we need to add 4kg of sand (since we already have 3kg of sand in the mixture) and remove an equal amount of clay. Let's call the amount of clay we need to remove ""x"" kg.

After we remove x kg of clay, we will have:
- Sand: 3kg + 4kg = 7kg
- Clay: 7kg - x kg

We want these two quantities to be equal, so:

This means we don't need to remove any clay, we just need to add 4kg of sand. To do this, we can remove x kg of the original mixture and replace it with 4kg of pure sand. The amount we need to remove can be found using the following proportion:

x/10kg = 4kg/100%
x = 0.4kg

So we need to remove 0.4kg of the original mixture and replace it with 4kg of pure sand. The total amount of mixture after this operation will be 10kg - 0.4kg + 4kg = 13.6kg.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.A)144km, B)72 km, C)126km, D)84 km, E)48km",E,"Let the distance between X and Y be d km.
Let the time taken for Allen to reach Y be t hours.
Then, the time taken for Bob to reach X would also be t hours.
Distance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t
Distance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t
When they meet for the first time, their total distance covered would be d.
When they meet for the second time, their total distance covered would be 2d.
At the second meeting, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen.
So, 78t + 54t + 48 = 2d
132t + 48 = 2d
66t + 24 = d
Now, we need to find a value of t such that Allen covers a distance of (d/2) km in that time.
Distance covered by Allen in (t/2) hours = 54(t/2) = 27t
Distance covered by Bob in (t/2) hours = 78(t/2) = 39t
Total distance covered by both of them in (t/2) hours = 27t + 39t = 66t
This should be equal to (d/2) km.
So, 66t = (d/2)
Substituting the value of d from earlier, we get:
66t = (66t + 24)/2
132t = 66t + 24
66t = 24
t = 24/66 = 4/11 hours
Distance between X and Y = d = 66t + 24 = 66(4/11) + 24 = 24 + 24 = 48 km
Therefore, the answer is E) 48km.",,48.0,1

A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%",C,"The cost of purchasing new tires and using them for 4 years is $180 x 4 = $720.
The cost of repairing current tires and using them for 1 year is $40 x 1 = $40.
So the average cost per year of new tires is $720/4 = $180, and the average cost per year of repairing current tires is $40/1 = $40.
The percent increase from $40 to $180 is (180-40)/40 x 100% = 350%.
Therefore, the average cost per year of new tires is 350% - 100% = 250% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.
This is equivalent to a percent increase of 250/100 = 2.5 or 25%.

If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125",C,"Let's denote the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both as B. We know that:

V + W + B = 250 (since all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
W = 2.5B (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both)

We want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm, which is equal to the number of files that were either not infected at all or were only infected by a virus. We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so:

V + B = 0.5(250) = 125

We can substitute the second equation into this one to get:

V + 3.5B = 125

We can also substitute the first equation into this one to get:

250 - W = V + B

We can substitute the second equation into this one to get:

250 - W = V + 3.5B

We can substitute the first equation into this one to get:

250 - (2.5B + W) = V + B

We can substitute the second equation into this one to get:

250 - (2.5B + 2.5B) = V + 3.5B

Simplifying this equation, we get:

250 - 5B = 4B + 125

Solving for B, we get:

B = 25

Substituting this back into the equation W = 2.5B, we get:

W = 62.5

Substituting both B and W into the equation V + B = 125, we get:

V + 25 = 125

V = 100

So there are 100 files that were either not infected at all or were only infected by a virus. Therefore, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is:

100 + 25 = 125

The answer is E.",,125.0,1

We know that w/25 gallons pass through every x seconds, so we can convert this to gallons per minute by multiplying by 60/x:

w/25 * 60/x = 12w/x

So the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of 12w/x gallons per minute. To find how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain, we can set up a proportion:

12w/x = y/t

where t is the time in minutes. Solving for t, we get:

t = xy/12w

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?A)36 grams, B)40 grams, C)42 grams, D)48 grams, E)50 grams",B,"The volume of the coin is given by V = πr^2h = π(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5 mm^3. Let the weight of aluminum in the alloy be x grams, then the weight of silver in the alloy is 2x grams. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we have:

ρ_aluminum x = ρ_silver 2x
where ρ_aluminum and ρ_silver are the densities of aluminum and silver, respectively. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we have:

ρ_silver = 2ρ_aluminum
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

x = 2x/2
Solving for x, we get x = 0, which means the coin is made entirely of silver. This is a contradiction, since the coin is known to be made of an alloy of aluminum and silver. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement.

Assuming that the problem statement meant to say that the volume of aluminum equals half that of silver, we can proceed as follows:

Let the volume of aluminum in the alloy be V_aluminum, then the volume of silver in the alloy is V_silver = 2V_aluminum. Let the density of aluminum be ρ_aluminum and the density of silver be ρ_silver. Then we have:

V_aluminumρ_aluminum + V_silverρ_silver = 30
Substituting V_silver = 2V_aluminum and ρ_silver = 2ρ_aluminum, we get:

3V_aluminumρ_aluminum = 30
Solving for V_aluminum, we get V_aluminum = 10 mm^3. Therefore, the volume of silver in the alloy is V_silver = 20 mm^3.

The volume of the pure aluminum coin is given by V = πr^2h = π(15)^2(1) = 225π mm^3. Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals half that of silver, we have:

V_aluminum = V_silver/2
ρ_aluminumV_aluminum = ρ_silverV_silver/2
Substituting ρ_silver = 2ρ_aluminum, we get:

ρ_aluminumV_aluminum = 2ρ_aluminumV_silver/2
Solving for ρ_aluminum, we get:

ρ_aluminum = V_silver/V_aluminum x 2 = 20/10 x 2 = 40 g/cm^3
Therefore, the weight of the pure aluminum coin is:

ρ_aluminumV = 40 x 225π = 9000π g ≈ 28,274 g ≈ 28.3 g

Then, we know that the time it takes him to return by car is also ""x"" because the distance and speed are the same. 

So, the total time for the round trip is x + x = 2x, which we know is 17 hours. 

If he loses 4 hours by going both ways by train, then the total time for the round trip by train is 17 + 4 = 21 hours. 

To find out how long it would take if he traveled by car both ways, we can use the fact that the time difference between the two methods of transportation is 4 hours. 

So, if he takes x hours by train and y hours by car, we know that y = x - 4. 

Substituting this into the total time equation, we get: 

x + (x - 4) = 17 

Simplifying: 

2x - 4 = 17 

2x = 21 

x = 10.5 

So, it takes Mr. Sam 10.5 hours to travel to the city by train. 

Using the equation y = x - 4, we can find out how long it would take him to travel by car both ways: 

y = 10.5 - 4 = 6.5 

So, it would take him 6.5 hours to travel by car both ways.

If he finishes two-thirds of the work, then the remaining one-third of the work is left for Jill to do. Let's call the total amount of work W.

Jack finishes (2/3)W in 2/3(12) = 8 hours. This means that he cleaned at a rate of (2/3)W/8 = (1/24)W per hour.

The remaining one-third of the work is (1/3)W. Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so her rate is (5/100)(1/12)W = (1/240)W per hour.

Let's call the amount of time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work t. We can set up an equation based on the fact that the total amount of work is W:

(1/24)W(8) + (1/240)W(t) = W/3

Simplifying this equation, we get:

(1/3)W - (1/24)W(8) = (1/240)W(t)

Multiplying both sides by 240, we get:

First, we can count the number of ways to select 3 candy bars without any restrictions. This is simply the number of combinations of 3 candy bars from 11, which is 11 choose 3 = 165. 

Next, we can count the number of ways to select 3 candy bars that cost less than or equal to $4. We can do this by considering all possible combinations of candy bars that cost less than or equal to $4: 

- Three candy bars that cost 50 cents each: There is only 1 way to select 3 of these candy bars. 
- Two candy bars that cost $1 each and one candy bar that costs 50 cents: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to select 2 of the $1 candy bars, and 3 ways to select the 50 cent candy bar. So there are 6 x 3 = 18 ways to select 3 candy bars in this category. 
- One candy bar that costs $2 and two candy bars that cost $1 each: There are 4 choose 1 = 4 ways to select the $2 candy bar, and 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to select 2 of the $1 candy bars. So there are 4 x 6 = 24 ways to select 3 candy bars in this category. 
- Three candy bars that cost $1 each: There is only 1 way to select 3 of these candy bars. 
- Two candy bars that cost $2 each and one candy bar that costs 50 cents: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to select 2 of the $2 candy bars, and 3 ways to select the 50 cent candy bar. So there are 6 x 3 = 18 ways to select 3 candy bars in this category. 

The total number of ways to select 3 candy bars that cost less than or equal to $4 is 1 + 18 + 24 + 1 + 18 = 62.

We can simplify equation 2 by substituting F = 2S - J:

J + (2S - J) = 2S
S = J

So we know that Joe's sister is the same age as Joe. Now we can substitute S = J into equation 1:

2J + F = 100

We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Let's call that age X:

J + X = 2(S + X - F)
J + X = 2(J + X - F)
F = X - J

Now we have two equations with two variables (2J + F = 100 and F = X - J), so we need one more equation to solve for all three variables. We can use the fact that Joe's sister will be twice as old when Joe is as old as his father:

S + X = 2(J + X - J)
