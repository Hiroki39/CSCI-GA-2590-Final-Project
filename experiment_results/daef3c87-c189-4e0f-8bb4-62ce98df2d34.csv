0,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?",A,"
A)10 minutes, B)15 minutes, C)20 minutes, D)25 minutes, E)30 minutes

1,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?",E,"
A) $10, B) $12, C) $14, D) $16, E) $18
Mapping:{x: original price of the item, y: discounted price of the item, z: $20-off coupon, w: $1.90 more than half the original price of the item}
‘Eq1:x*0.78=y’
‘Eq2:y-z=w’
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
x,y,z,w = symbols('x, y, z, w')
Eq1 = Eq(x*0.78,y)
Eq2 = Eq(y-z,w)
