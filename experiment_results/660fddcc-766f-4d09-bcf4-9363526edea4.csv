A: mapping:{x:pieces of candy left}
Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night,
Eq1: 32+42-35=x
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,32+42-35)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 39 from sympy, so the answer is 39.",,39.0,1
1, A pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. During a sale they sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left? ,8.0,"
A: mapping:{x: cats they have left}
Eq1: x=13+5-10
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,13+5-10)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 8 from sympy, so the answer is 8.",,8.0,1
