12,In a school there are 458 more girls than boys. If there are 692 girlsHow many pupils are there in that school?,926.0,"Let's call the number of boys in the school ""B"". We know that there are 458 more girls than boys, so the number of girls in the school is ""B + 458"". We also know that there are 692 girls in the school. So we can set up an equation:

B + 458 = 692

To solve for B, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 458 from both sides:

B + 458 - 458 = 692 - 458

B = 234

After giving some to Jeff, she has 415 cards left.
So she gave away 665 - 415 = 250 cards.
Let's assume she gave away x baseball cards and y Ace cards.
Then we have the equations:
x + y = 250 (total cards given away)
309 - x = 415 - y (cards left after giving away)
Simplifying the second equation, we get:
y - x = 106
Adding this equation to the first equation, we get:
2y = 356
y = 178
Substituting y = 178 into the first equation, we get:
x + 178 = 250
x = 72
So Nell gave away 72 baseball cards and 178 Ace cards.
Now she has 415 - 72 = 343 baseball cards left and 356 - 178 = 178 Ace cards left.
Therefore, Nell has 343 - 178 = 165 more baseball cards than Ace cards. The answer is 165.",,165.0,0

120,Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homeworkHow many pages of reading homework did she have to complete?,3.0,"Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework and 4 more pages than reading homework. Let's call the number of pages of reading homework ""r"". So, the number of pages of math homework is r + 4. We know that Rachel had to complete a total of 7 pages of math homework and reading homework combined. So, we can set up the equation:

r + (r + 4) = 7

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2r + 4 = 7

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:

2r = 3

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

r = 1.5

Since Rachel can't complete half a page of reading homework, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework. The answer is 2.",,2.0,0

This doesn't make sense, so we need to adjust our approach. 

Let's start with Jill's number of peaches as the unknown variable, x. 

Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, so he has x + 8 peaches. We know that Steven has 5 peaches, so we can set up an equation: 

x + 8 = 5 

Solving for x, we get:

Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 5 - 3 = 2 peaches. We can set up an equation: 

y = 2 + 3 

We also know that Steven has 5 peaches, which means Jill must have y - 8 peaches. 

So the final equation is:

784,Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground while Ed found 9 more marbles.How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?,60.0,"Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Doug had before he lost 27. We know that Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, so if we subtract 24 from Ed's total after he found 9 more marbles, we should get Doug's total before he lost any. 

Ed found 9 more marbles, so he now has: 
Ed = Doug + 24 + 9 
Ed = Doug + 33 

To find Doug's total before he lost any marbles, we can subtract 24 from Ed's total: 
Doug = Ed - 24 
Doug = (Doug + 33) - 24 
Doug = Doug + 9 

This doesn't make sense - if we subtract the same number from both sides of an equation, the equation should still be true. But in this case, we've ended up with an equation that says Doug is equal to Doug plus 9, which is impossible. 

This means there must be an error in the problem statement. Perhaps it should say that Doug lost 9 marbles instead of 27? In that case, we can solve the problem as follows: 

If Doug lost 9 marbles, he now has: 
Doug = Doug - 9 

And if Ed found 9 more marbles, he now has: 
Ed = Doug + 24 + 9 
Ed = Doug + 33 

So the difference between Ed and Doug's totals is: 
Ed - Doug = (Doug + 33) - (Doug - 9) 
Ed - Doug = 33 + 9 
Ed - Doug = 42 

Therefore, Ed had 42 more marbles than Doug after Doug lost 9 marbles and Ed found 9 more.",,9.0,1

847,Together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples. He has 4 apples more than adam and jackie together do.How many apples does he have?,10.0,"Let's start by setting up an equation. Let x be the number of apples Adam has. Then, Jackie has 6 - x apples. We know that he has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so:

x + (6 - x) + 4 = total number of apples he has

Simplifying this equation, we get:

10 - x = total number of apples he has

Now we need to solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-x = total number of apples he has - 10

And then multiplying both sides by -1 to isolate x:

x = 10 - total number of apples he has

So if we know how many apples he has, we can use this equation to find out how many Adam has. For example, if he has 12 apples:

x = 10 - 12 = -2

This doesn't make sense, so we know that he can't have 12 apples. Let's try another number, like 8:

x = 10 - 8 = 2

This makes sense - if he has 2 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, and they have 6 apples, then he must have 8 apples. So the answer is 8.",,8.0,1
