Tom bought 40 tickets. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth. So he had 40 - 28 tickets left for rides. Each ride cost 4 tickets. So he could go on (40-28)/4 rides.

597," The cafeteria had 75 apples. For lunch they handed out 19 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make? ",[7.0],"mapping:{x: pies they could make}
The cafeteria had 75 apples. They handed out 19 to students, so they had 75 - 19 apples left. They want to make pies with the remaining apples, and each pie takes 8 apples. So the number of pies they can make is (75 - 19) / 8.
Eq1: x=(75-19)/8

x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,(75-19)/8)

Sarah baked 38 cupcakes. Todd ate 14 of them. So Sarah has 38 - 14 cupcakes left. She wants to put 8 cupcakes in each package. So the number of packages she can make is (38 - 14) / 8.

Nancy uploaded 41 pictures. She put 37 pictures in one album and the rest in 2 different albums. So the number of pictures in the other two albums is 41-37. 
Eq1: x + y = 41-37
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
