There were originally 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. So let's say she added r roses and o orchids. After that, there were 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. So we can write the equation:
Eq1: (6+o)/(9+r) = 13/3
We can simplify this equation by cross-multiplying:
(6+o)*3 = 13*(9+r)
18+3o = 117+13r
3o-13r = 99
We want to find the difference between the number of orchids and roses, so we can write another equation:
Eq2: o-r = x
We can solve for o and r in terms of x by adding Eq2 to 3 times Eq1:
3o - 3r = 3x
3o - 13r = 99
-10r = 99 - 3x
r = (3x - 99)/10
Substituting this into Eq2:
o - (3x-99)/10 = x
o = (13x + 99)/10
Now we can substitute these expressions for o and r into Eq1 and solve for x:
(6 + (13x+99)/10)/(9 + (3x-99)/10) = 13/3
Simplifying:
(60 + 13x + 99)/(90 + 3x - 99) = 13/3
(13x + 159)/(3x - 9) = 13/3
Cross-multiplying:
39x - 117 = 39x + 507
x = -144/39
We can't have a negative number of orchids, so the answer is 0. There are no more orchids than roses in the vase now.",,

Haley initially had 3 trees. After the typhoon, 13 trees died. So the number of trees that survived is 3 - (13) = -10. Since it doesn't make sense to have negative trees, we can say that all 13 trees died and none survived.

Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so Steven has 9 more peaches than Jake. 
Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill. 
Steven has 16 peaches. 
So, Jill has 16 - 18 = -2 peaches. (This doesn't make sense, so we can assume that there was an error in the problem statement or that Jill actually has 18 more peaches than Jake.)

Assuming that Jill has 18 more peaches than Jake:
Jake = x
Steven = x + 9
Jill = x - 18

Steven has x + 9 peaches and Jill has x - 18 + 18 = x peaches. 
We want to find how many more peaches Steven has than Jill, so we subtract their quantities:

David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can write y = x + 56. David did 38 push-ups, so y = 38. To find

Substituting Jackie's value into the third equation, we get:
