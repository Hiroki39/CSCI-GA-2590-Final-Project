0,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?A)5(√3 + 1), B)6(√3 + √2), C)7(√3 – 1), D)8(√3 – 2), E)None of these",A," The car is moving in a straight line, so the rate of change of the angle of elevation is constant. Since it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°, it will take 5 more minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 60° to 75°. So the car will reach the base of the tower in 15 minutes. The answer is A.",
1,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?A)$61, B)$65, C)$67.40, D)$70, E)$78.20",E," Let x be the original price of the item. Then the discounted price is 0.78x. The customer pays $20 less than this, so
the total cost is 0.78x - 20. The customer pays $1.90 more than half the original price, so 0.78x - 20 > 0.5x + 1.90.
This simplifies to 0.28x > 21.90. So x > 78.21. The closest option is 78.20, so the answer is e.",
