So, we have:

1/2 base * height = 70

We also know that the base and height of a triangle are the same as the length and width of the rectangle, respectively. So, we can write:

1/2 length * width = 70

We also know that the length and width of a rectangle are the same as the side length of a square. So, we can write:

1/2 side length * side length = 70

We can solve for side length by taking the square root of both sides:

side length = square root of 140

Now that we know the side length, we can calculate the perimeter. The perimeter of a square is 4 * side length. So:

perimeter = 4 * side length

perimeter = 4 * square root of 140

perimeter = 2 * square root of 140 * 2

perimeter = 2 * 10 * 2

perimeter = 40
