The cafeteria had 75 apples. They handed out 19 apples to students, so they have 75-19 = 56 apples left.
Each pie takes 8 apples, so the number of pies they could make is 56/8.
Eq1: x = 56/8

599, Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? ,2.0,"A: mapping:{x:number of pictures in one album, y:number of pictures in the other album}
Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums.
Eq1: x + y = 41 - 37
Eq2: x + y = 4
Since we don't know how many pictures were in each album, we need another equation to solve for x and y. We know that the number of pictures in the two albums must add up to 4, so we can write:
Eq3: x + 2y = 4
Now we can solve for x and y using sympy:
from sympy import *
x, y = symbols('x y')
eq1 = Eq(x + y, 4)
eq2 = Eq(x + 2*y, 4)
sol = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
print(sol)
We get x = 2 and y = 1, so there were 2 pictures in one album and 1 picture in the other album.",,1.0
