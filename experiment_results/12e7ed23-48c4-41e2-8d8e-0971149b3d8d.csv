0,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?A)5(√3 + 1), B)6(√3 + √2), C)7(√3 – 1), D)8(√3 – 2), E)None of these",A,"Let the height of the tower be h and the distance between the car and the base of the tower be x. Then, we can use trigonometry to set up the following equations:

h/x = tan(45°) = 1
h/(x + vt) = tan(60°) = √3

where v is the speed of the car and t is the additional time it takes to reach the base of the tower. Solving for h and equating the two expressions, we get:

x + vt = x√3
vt = x(√3 - 1)

We are given that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes, so we can use the formula:

tan(60°) - tan(45°) = (h/x) / (x + vt)

Substituting the values we know, we get:

√3 - 1 = 1 / (x + 10v/6)

Solving for x + 10v/6, we get:

x + 10v/6 = 1 / (√3 - 1) = √3 + 1

Therefore, the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is:

t = (x + 10v/6) / v = 5(√3 + 1)

Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?A)40, B)200, C)380, D)400, E)3200",D,"If 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, then the total number of marbles in the bag before the painting was 20. After painting, there are still 20 marbles in the bag, but some of them are now black. Let's say there are x black marbles in the bag now. Then, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is (x/20)*100.

When another 20 marbles are pulled out, only 1 of them is black. This means that the ratio of black to white marbles in the bag is 1:19. We can set up an equation to solve for x:

x / (20 + x) = 1/19

Solving for x, we get x = 20/18 = 10/9

35% of 200 students took part in the debating session, which is 70 students. This means that 130 students did not take part in the debating session. 

To find the maximum number of students who did not attend either event, we need to find the overlap between the two groups. The minimum number of students who attended both events would be the difference between the total number of students who attended each event and the total number of students in the school (200). 

So, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:

What is the speed of the elevator?A)1 step/minute, B)2 step/minute, C)3 step/minute, D)4 step/minute, E)None of the above",A,"Let's assume that the total number of steps in the staircase is ""x"". 
From the first statement, we can write: 
(x-20) steps in remaining time = 20 steps in 10 minutes 
Simplifying this, we get: 
(x-20)/(10) = 20 
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 220 steps 

Similarly, from the second statement, we can write: 
(x-10) steps in remaining time = 10 steps in 20 minutes 
Simplifying this, we get: 
(x-10)/(20) = 10 
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 210 steps 

Now, we can calculate the speed of the elevator as follows: 
Total distance = 220 steps

Then, we know that:

(x + 10*42)/22 = average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period

Simplifying this equation, we get:

(x + 420)/22 = (x/10 + 42)/2

Multiplying both sides by 220, we get:

10x + 4200 = 22x + 9240

Solving for x, we get:

yz - H - L

We can substitute 2x for H+L:

yz - 2x

To find the average score excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we divide this sum by the number of students in the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, which is z-2:

20,"A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?A)12, B)16, C)24, D)30, E)40",C,"Let's start by finding the cost price of each bag of flour. If the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, then the cost price must be 75% of the selling price. 

75% of $100 = $75 

So the cost price of each bag of flour is $75. 

Now we can use the profit formula: 

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price 

$3,000 = ($100 x number of bags) - ($75 x number of bags) 

$3,000 = $25 x number of bags 

Number of bags = $3,000 / $25 = 120 

So the grocer sold 120 bags of flour. 

But wait, the answer choices don't include 120! We need to remember that the question is asking for the number of bags sold, not the total profit. Since the grocer made a $25 profit on each bag ($100 selling price - $75 cost price), we can also divide the total profit by the profit per bag: 

$3,000 / $25 = 120 

So the grocer sold 120 bags of flour. The answer is not given in the answer choices, but the closest option is D) 30. However, this is not the correct answer.",,30.0,0

We also know that together they made 35 toys, so:

- Alex made x toys, and Jacob made (35 - x) toys.

Finally, we know that they worked for almost similar number of hours, so we can set their work hours equal to each other:

- 7x = 9x
- 2x = 35

After the second replacement, he has 72.25 ml of 50% strong milk tea and 27.75 ml of milk.

Now, he replaces 10% of this resultant solution with more milk. 10% of 72.25 ml is 7.225 ml, so he adds this much milk to the solution. The final solution has 72.25 ml of 50% strong milk tea and 35.975 ml of milk.

To find the final concentration of tea, we need to calculate the percentage of tea in the final solution. The total volume of the final solution is 72.25 ml + 35.975 ml = 108.225 ml. The total amount of tea in the final solution is 72.25 ml. So the percentage of tea in the final solution is:

- Number of students studying math = (5/80)x
- Number of students studying bio = (8/80)x
- Number of students studying English = (10/80)x

Adding these up, we get:

(5/80)x + (8/80)x + (10/80)x = (23/80)x

We know that (23/80)x is a 4-digit number, so we can assume that x is also a 4-digit number. The smallest 4-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999. Substituting these values for x, we get:

- If x = 1000, then (23/80)x = 287.5, which is not a whole number.
- If x = 9999, then (23/80)x = 2874.375, which is also not a whole number.

When folded along one set of sides, each part will have a length of l/2 and a width of w, so the perimeter of each part will be 2(l/2 + w) = l + 2w. Similarly, when folded along the other set of sides, each part will have a length of l and a width of w/2, so the perimeter of each part will be 2(l + w/2) = 2l + w.

We are given that the perimeter of each part is 48cm and 66cm respectively, so we can write the following equations:

l + 2w = 48/2 = 24
2l + w = 66/2 = 33

After a 5% discount, the selling price becomes 0.95x. 
After a 7% discount, the selling price becomes 0.93x. 
Given that the profit earned with a 7% discount is Rs. 15 less than the profit earned with a 5% discount. 
So, 0.07x - 0.93c = 0.05x - 0.95x + 15 
0.02x = 15 + 0.02c 
Substituting x = c/0.95 in the above equation, we get

Average speed = Total distance covered / Total time taken

The total distance covered is 4 times the length of one side of the square. Let's assume the length of one side is x km. Then the total distance covered is 4x km.

The time taken to cover each side is given by the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So the time taken to cover each side is:

Side 1: x / 200 hours
Side 2: x / 400 hours
Side 3: x / 600 hours
Side 4: x / 800 hours

The total time taken to cover all four sides is the sum of these times:

Total time = x/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800

To simplify this expression, we can find a common denominator:

Total time = (6x + 3x + 2x + 1.5x) / 2400
Total time = 12.5x / 2400 hours

Now we can substitute the values of total distance and total time into the formula for average speed:

Average speed = 4x / (12.5x / 2400)
Average speed = 960 km/hr

Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is 960 km/hr. The answer is not given in the answer choices, so it may be a typo or an error in the question.",,960.0,1

We know that:

- Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8 pool per hour.
- Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so it filled 2/8 or 1/4 of the pool.
- The two hoses, working together, finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. Let's call the fraction of the pool that hose B filled in that time ""x"". Then we can set up the equation:

(1/8 + b) * 3 = x

- We also know that the two hoses together filled the remaining 3/4 of the pool, so we can set up another equation:

a * 3 + b * 3 = 3/4

Now we can solve for b. First, simplify the second equation:

3a + 3b = 3/4
a + b = 1/4

Substitute a = 1/8 into this equation:

1/8 + b = 1/4

Then, 24 students are members of both the chess club and swim team. Let's call the number of students who are only members of the swim team ""x"". Then, the number of students who are members of the swim team (including those who are also in the chess club) is 0.8x + 24. 

We want to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, which is (0.8x + 24)/100. We can simplify this by first finding the value of x. 

Since 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and swim team, we know that (0.24)(100) = 24 students are in both. We also know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, which means that 80% of members of the swim team are also members of the chess club. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

0.8x + 24 = 0.8(total number of swim team members) 

0.8x + 24 = 0.8(0.8x + 24) 

0.8x + 24 = 0.64x + 19.2 

0.16x = 4.8 

x = 30 

Now we can plug in x = 30 to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team:

The harbor line train starts at 5:02 and has a frequency of 10 minutes, so the next train will come at 5:12, 5:22, and so on.

To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to find the time interval between the first train from the main line and the first train from the harbor line. The first train from the main line comes at 5 o'clock, and the first train from the harbor line comes at 5:02. So the time interval between them is 2 minutes.

Since both trains have a frequency of 10 minutes, the next train from the main line will come at 5:10, and the next train from the harbor line will come at 5:12. So if the man arrives at the station between 5:02 and 5:10, he will catch the harbor line train, and if he arrives between 5:10 and 5:12, he will catch the main line train.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is the probability of him arriving at the station between 5:02 and 5:10, which is 8 minutes out of the total time interval of 10 minutes between 5:00 and 5:10. So the probability is 8/10 or 0.8. The answer is B) 0.8.",,0.8,0

y + 30 = 2x - 60
2x - y = 90  ----(1)
According to the second condition, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. So we can write:

- 4x + 1(7y) = 210 (the hotel pays $4 per Sunday paper and $1 per paper on the other days, and the total cost per week is $210)

We can use the first equation to substitute for x in the second equation:

4(2y) + 7y = 210
8y + 7y = 210
15y = 210
y = 14

So the hotel orders 14 papers on each of the other days of the week. To find out how many papers it buys on Monday specifically, we can use the fact that there are 7 days in a week and the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday:

x + 6y = total number of papers ordered per week
2y + 6y = 8y (substituting x = 2y)
8y = total number of papers ordered per week
8y = 2x + 6y (substituting x = 2y)
2y = 2x
y = x

So the hotel buys the same number of papers on Monday as it does on any other day of the week, which we found to be 14. The answer is B) 30.",,30.0,0

115,"At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?A)50 m, B)75 m, C)100 m, D)125 m, E)150 m",C,"We can start by finding the shuttle's speed. In 40 seconds, it travels 700m, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s. We also know that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so during that time it travels a distance of 17.5 x 5 = 87.5m. 

Let's assume that the length of the shuttle is L. During the 5 seconds it takes to pass a point, both the front and back of the shuttle will have moved a distance of L. So the total distance covered during this time is 2L. 

We can set up an equation: 

2L + 87.5 = speed x time 

where speed is 17.5 m/s and time is 5 seconds. 

Simplifying: 

2L + 87.5 = 17.5 x 5 

2L + 87.5 = 87.5 

2L = 0 

This doesn't make sense - it means the length of the shuttle is 0! 

So there must be an error in the problem statement. Perhaps the shuttle takes 50 seconds to reach the height of 700m instead of 40 seconds? In that case, the speed would be 700/50 = 14 m/s, and we would get: 

2L + 87.5 = 14 x 5 

2L + 87.5 = 70 

2L = -17.5 

Again, this doesn't make sense - a length can't be negative.

116,"A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?A)2 months, B)4 months, C)23 months, D)24 months, E)84 months",B,"Let's first find the total investment of A and B for the whole year. A invested for 12 months, while B invested for 10 months (since he joined after 2 months). So their total investment is:

A's investment = Rs.40,000 × 12 = Rs.480,000
B's investment = Rs.60,000 × 10 = Rs.600,000

Total investment = Rs.480,000 + Rs.600,000 = Rs.1,080,000

Now, let's find C's investment. We know that C gets Rs.150,000 as his share of the profit, which is 150,000/375,000 = 2/5 of the total profit. So his investment must be 2/5 of the total investment:

C's investment = (2/5) × Rs.1,080,000 = Rs.432,000

C joined after B, so let's assume he joined after x months. Then, his investment for the remaining (12-x) months would be:

C's investment = Rs.120,000 × (12-x) / 12 = Rs.10,000 × (12-x)

Now we can set up an equation using the total investment:

Rs.480,000 + Rs.600,000 + Rs.432,000 + Rs.10,000 × (12-x) = Rs.1,080,000

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Rs.1,512,000 - Rs.10,000x = Rs.1,080,000
Rs.432,000 = Rs.10,000x
x = 43.2

- 0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40 (the total amount earned from the dive)

We want to find the minimum number of copper coins, so we want to minimize x. We can use substitution to solve for y in terms of x:

- y = (3.40 - 0.20x) / 0.25
- y = 13.6 - 0.8x

Now we can substitute this expression for y into the second equation:

- x + (13.6 - 0.8x) = the total number of coins brought up
- 0.2x + 13.6 = the total number of coins brought up

We want to minimize x, so we want to maximize the total number of coins brought up. The only way to do this is to have as many brass coins as possible (since they earn more money). So let's assume that all the coins brought up are brass coins:

- 0.25y = 3.40
- y = 13.6

This means the diver brought up 13.6 brass coins. Since the diver can only bring up whole coins, the minimum number of copper coins she brought up is:

- x = the total number of coins brought up - y

At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?A)1 hr 23 min, B)1 hr 15 min, C)1 hr 8 min, D)56 min, E)55 min",D,"Let's assume that the two trains meet at time t after Train N leaves City B. At that time, Train M has been traveling for t hours and Train N has been traveling for (t-2) hours. We know that the distance traveled by both trains is the same, so we can set up the equation:

Distance traveled by Train M = Distance traveled by Train N
Speed of Train M x t = Speed of Train N x (t-2)

We also know that the distance between City A and City B is the same as the sum of the distances traveled by the two trains:

Distance between City A and City B = Speed of Train M x t + Speed of Train N x (t-2)

We can substitute the given values into these equations:

Distance between City A and City B = 4 hours x Speed of Train M
Speed of Train M x t = Speed of Train N x (t-2)

We can solve for t by substituting the first equation into the second equation:

4 hours x Speed of Train M x t = Speed of Train N x (t-2)
4 hours x Speed of Train M x t = Speed of Train N x t - 2 x Speed of Train N
4 hours x Speed of Train M x t - Speed of Train N x t = -2 x Speed of Train N
t (4 hours x Speed of Train M - Speed of Train N) = -2 x Speed of Train N
t = -2 x Speed of Train N / (4 hours x Speed of Train M - Speed of Train N)

We can plug in the given values for the speeds of the two trains:

t = -2 x (Distance between City A and City B) / (4 hours x Speed of Train M - Speed of Train N)
t = -2 x (Distance between City A and City B) / (4 hours x Speed of Train M - 3/2 x Speed of Train M)
t = -2 x (Distance between City A and City B) / (5/2 x Speed of Train M)
t = -4/5 hours x (Distance between City A and City B) / Speed of Train M

We know that the distance between City A and City B is 4 hours x Speed of Train M, so we can substitute that value in:

t = -4/5 hours x (4 hours x Speed of Train M) / Speed of Train M
t = -16/5 hours

This is a negative value, which doesn't make sense. It means that the two trains never meet. We made a mistake somewhere in our calculations. Let's check our equations:

Distance traveled by Train M = Distance traveled by Train N
Speed of Train M x t = Speed of Train N x (t-2)

4 hours x Speed of Train M = (t-2) x Speed of Train N

We made a mistake in the second equation. We should have used the time t-2 for Train M instead of t:

Distance traveled by Train M = Distance traveled by Train N
Speed of Train M x (t-2) = Speed of Train N x t

4 hours x Speed of Train M - 8 x Speed of Train M / 3 = 2.5 x Speed of Train N

We can simplify this equation:

4 hours x Speed of Train M - 8/3 hours x Speed of Train M = 2.5 hours x Speed of Train N
4/3 hours x Speed of Train M = 2.5 hours x Speed of Train N
Speed of Train N = 4/3 x Speed of Train M / 2.5
Speed of Train N = 8/15 x Speed of Train M

We can substitute this value into our equation for t:

4 hours x Speed of Train M = (t-2) x 8/15 x Speed of Train M
t = 4 hours - 10/3 hours
t = 2/3 hours
t = 40 minutes

So the two trains cross each other 40 minutes after Train N leaves City B, which is at 7:40 am. The answer is not one of the given choices.",,40.0,1

2x/2y = 2/5
=> y = 5x/4

The area of the walls is given by:

2x(2y) - 15 = 4xy - 15

We know that the area of the walls is equal to the length of paper required multiplied by the width of the paper. So we have:

4xy - 15 = (length of paper required) x (0.5m)

=> length of paper required = 8xy - 30

The cost of the paper is given by:

(cost per meter) x (length of paper required) = 2(8xy - 30)

= 16xy - 60

We know that this cost is equal to Rs.260. So we have:

16xy - 60 = 260

=> 16xy = 320

=> xy = 20

Substituting y = 5x/4, we get:

5x^2/4 = 20

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51

We also know that the first integer is -50, so:

-50 + (-50+1) + (-50+2) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51

Simplifying this expression, we get:

k(-50) + (1+2+3+...+k-1) = 51

Using the formula for the sum of consecutive integers (1+2+3+...+k-1 = k(k-1)/2), we can rewrite this as:

k(-50) + k(k-1)/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get:

-100k + k(k-1) = 102

Expanding the right side, we get:

-100k + k^2 - k = 102

k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

k = (101 ± sqrt(101^2 - 4(1)(102))) / 2

k = (101 ± sqrt(10121)) / 2

k = (101 ± 101) / 2

Let the time taken for Allen to reach Y be t hours. Then, the time taken for Bob to reach X is also t hours. 
Distance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t
Distance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t
When they meet for the first time, the total distance covered by both of them is d. 
So, 54t + 78t = d
132t = d
When they meet for the second time, Allen has covered a distance of 2d and Bob has covered a distance of 2d + 48 km. 
Distance covered by Allen in 2t hours = 54(2t) = 108t
Distance covered by Bob in 2t hours = 78(2t) = 156t
Since they meet at the same point, the total distance covered by both of them is 2d. 
So, 108t + 156t = 2d
264t = 2d
132t = d

This means the merchant can afford to borrow up to $19,200 at the highest simple interest rate that would result in a total repayment of $20,000 after 30 days. 

Let the interest rate be r. Then, the interest charged on $19,200 after 30 days is:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
Interest = $19,200 x r x (30/365)
Interest = $498.90r

The total repayment after 30 days is:

SI = (P * r * t) / 100
SI = (5000 * r * 2) / 100
SI = 100r

Using the formula for compound interest, we have:

CI = P * (1 + r/100)^t - P
CI = 5000 * (1 + r/100)^2 - 5000
CI = 5000 * (1 + 2r/100 + r^2/10000) - 5000
CI = 100r + 50r^2/100

The difference between CI and SI is given as Rs. 72, so:

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125",C,"Let the number of files infected only by a virus be V, the number of files infected only by a worm be W, and the number of files infected by both be B. We know that:

V + W + B = 250 (since all 250 files are infected)
W = 2.5B (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both)

We also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so:

V + B = 125

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:

V + 2.5B + B = 250
V + 3.5B = 250

And we can substitute the third equation into this equation to get:

V + 3.5(0.4)(V + B) = 250
V + 1.4V + 1.4B = 250
2.4V + 1.4B = 250

We can now solve for V:

V + B = 125
2.4V + 1.4B = 250

Multiplying the first equation by 1.4 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get:

2.4V + 1.4B - 1.4V - 1.4B = 250 - 175
1V = 75
V = 75

So there are 75 files infected only by a virus, and 125 files infected by a worm (since V + B = 125). The number of files not infected by a worm is:

So the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of 12w/x gallons per minute. To find how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through, we can set up a proportion:

Let x be the volume of aluminum in the alloy, then the volume of silver is also x. Let the density of aluminum be d, then the density of silver is 2d. The weight of aluminum in the coin is x*d and the weight of silver in the coin is x*2d. The total weight of the coin is x*d + x*2d = 3xd. We know that the total weight is 30 grams, so 3xd = 30, which means x = 10 mm^3. Therefore, the volume of aluminum in the coin is 10 mm^3 and the volume of silver is also 10 mm^3. The weight of the aluminum coin is its volume times its density, which is 10*d. We know that the diameter of the aluminum coin is twice that of the alloy coin, so its volume is 4 times that of the alloy coin. Therefore, the weight of the aluminum coin is 4*10*d = 40d grams. We are given that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so d/2 is the weight of 1 mm^3 of silver. Therefore, the weight of the silver in the alloy coin is 10*2*d/2 = 10d grams. The total weight of the alloy coin is 30 grams, so the weight of the aluminum in the alloy coin is 30 - 10d grams. We can set up an equation: 10d + 30 - 10d = 30, which means that the weight of the aluminum in the alloy coin is 0 grams. This is a contradiction, so the problem has no solution.

If he finishes two-thirds of the work, then he still has one-third of the work left to do. Let's call the total amount of work W. Then, Jack has done (2/3)W and there is (1/3)W left to do.

Let's call the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work t. We know that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so she can clean (1/20) of the yacht in 1 hour. Therefore, in t hours, she can clean (1/20)t of the yacht.

We know that the total amount of work is W, so we can set up an equation:

(2/3)W + (1/20)t = W

Simplifying this equation, we get:

(1/20)t = (1/3)W

Multiplying both sides by 20, we get:

t = (20/3)W

We know that Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so he can clean (1/12) of the yacht in 1 hour. Therefore, he can clean (2/3)(1/12) = (1/18) of the yacht in 1 hour. We can use this information to find W:

(1/18)W = (2/3)W

Multiplying both sides by 18/2, we get:

W = 9

Now we can substitute W = 9 into our equation for t:

t = (20/3)(9) = 60

Therefore, it takes Jill 60 hours to finish the remaining work. The answer is not given, so we can choose the closest option, which is D) 50.",,50.0,0

We need to select 3 candy bars from the 11 available, so the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars is C(11,3) = 165.

Now we need to count the number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4. We can do this by considering the different combinations of candy bars that we can select.

If we select three candy bars that each cost $2, then the total cost is $6, which is more than $4. There are C(4,3) = 4 ways to select three candy bars that each cost $2.

If we select two candy bars that cost $2 and one candy bar that costs $1, then the total cost is $5, which is more than $4. There are C(4,2) * C(4,1) = 24 ways to select two candy bars that cost $2 and one candy bar that costs $1.

If we select one candy bar that costs $2 and two candy bars that cost $1, then the total cost is $4, which is not more than $4. So we don't need to consider this case.

If we select three candy bars that each cost $1, then the total cost is $3, which is not more than $4. So we don't need to consider this case.

If we select three candy bars that each cost $0.50, then the total cost is $1.50, which is not more than $4. So we don't need to consider this case.

We also know that when J = F, S = 2S. This means that S will be twice her current age when J = F, so we can set up the equation:

J + (2S) + F = 100

Simplifying this equation, we get:

J + S + F = 100 - S

But we also know that when J = F, F = 2S. This means that S was half her current age when J = F, so we can set up another equation:

J + S + (2S) = F + S

Simplifying this equation, we get:

J + 3S = F + S

Now we have two equations with two variables (J and S). We can solve for S in the second equation:

J + 2S = F

2S = F - J

S = (F - J) / 2

We can substitute this expression for S into the first equation:

J + (2S) + F = 100

J + (2(F - J) / 2) + F = 100

2F - J = 100

J = 2F - 100

Now we can substitute this expression for J into the second equation:

J + 3S = F + S

(2F - 100) + 3((F - (2F - 100)) / 2) = F + ((F - (2F - 100)) / 2)
