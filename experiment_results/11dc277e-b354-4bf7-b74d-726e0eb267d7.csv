0,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.

Since it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°, it will take 5 more minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 60° to 75°. So the car will reach the base of the tower in 15 minutes. The answer is A.",
1,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?A)$61, B)$65, C)$67.40, D)$70, E)$78.20",E," Let x be the original price of the item. Then the discounted price is 0.78x. The customer pays $20 less than this, so
the total cost is 0.78x - 20. The customer pays $1.90 more than half the original price, so 0.78x - 20 > 0.5x + 1.90.
This simplifies to 0.28x > 21.90. So x > 78.21. The closest option is 78.20, so the answer is e.",

8,"Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110",E," If x is the number of students who did not attend the prom and y is the number of students who did not take part in the debating session, then we have the following two inequalities:

x + y ≤ 200

0.45x + 0.35y ≥ 0.45(200) + 0.35(200)

Solving these two inequalities, we get

x + y ≤ 200

3.5x + 7y ≥ 315

From the first inequality, we know that x + y ≤ 200. From the second inequality, we know that 3.5x + 7y ≥ 315. So

3.5x + 7y + x + y ≥ 315 + 200

4.5x + 8y ≥ 515

Since 4.5x + 8y is greater than or equal to 515, we know that 4.5x + 8y cannot be less than 515. So the maximum
number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 200 - 515 = -315.

What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?A)22, B)27, C)29, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of the above",D," We are given that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. We can represent this as follows:

Q - R = R - T

Q - T = 2(R - T)

Q - T = 2(T - R)

Q - T = 2(Q - R)

So the difference between Q and R's age is the same as the difference between R and T's age. We are also given that
the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So if we let R = x, then T = 50 - x. We can plug this into our equation for
Q - T:

Q - T = 2(Q - R)

Q - (50 - x) = 2(Q - x)

Q - 50 + x = 2Q - 2x

-50 + 2x = 2Q - Q

-50 + 2x = Q

Q = 2x - 50

We are told that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years, so we know that R + T = 50. We can plug this into our
equation for Q:

Q = 2x - 50

Q + R = 2x - 50 + R

Q + R = 2x - 50 + (50 - Q)

Q + R = 2x

Q + R = 2R

Q = R

So the difference between R and Q's age is 0, and the answer is e.",

the perimeter is 2(4b + 1 + b), which simplifies to 2(5b + 1). Since the area is 150 sq m, we know that 5b(b + 1) =
150. So b2 + b – 150 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we find that b = 15 or b = –10. However, the breadth
cannot be negative, so b = 15. So the perimeter is 2(5(15) + 1) = 122 m. The answer is c.",

How much does each daughter receive ?A)Rs 400, B)Rs 500, C)Rs 600, D)Rs 700, E)Rs 800",E," Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4 * x, where x is the amount
that each nephew receives. Each son receives five as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5 * x. We know that
the total amount of money is 8600, so we can set up the equation:
4 * x + 5 * x + 4 * x + 5 * x + 4 * x + 5 * x = 8600
This simplifies to 24 * x = 8600, so x = 8600 / 24 = 375. This means that each daughter receives 4 * 375 = 1500, and

101,"A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27",C," We can set up an equation to solve this problem. Let n be the number of members in the club. Then the sum of the ages of all the members is given by:

n(n + 1)/2 * 3 = 250

This equation can be simplified to:

3n^2 + 3n = 500

This equation can be further simplified to:

3n^2 + 3n - 500 = 0

Using the quadratic equation, we can solve for n:

n = (-3 +/- sqrt(9 + 1200)) / 6

n = (-3 +/- sqrt(1209)) / 6

n = (-3 +/- 34.7) / 6

n = (-36.7 +/- 34.7) / 6

n = (-36.7 +/- 59.4) / 6

n = (-96.1 +/- 59.4) / 6

n = (-96.1 +/- 77.5) / 6

n = (-173.6 +/- 77.5) / 6

n = (-173.6 +/- 87.9) / 6

n = (-261.5 +/- 87.9) / 6

Since we are looking for a positive integer solution, we can ignore the negative root. So n = (261.5 +/- 87.9) / 6. This gives us two possible solutions: n = 174.4/6 and n = 348.9/6. However, since n must be a positive integer, n cannot be equal to 174.4/6. So the only possible solution is n = 348.9/6, which is equal to 58.15. Therefore, there are 58 members in the club. The answer is D.",

then John will have 3/4x + x/2 = 75. Similarly, if John gives Mark one third of his money, then Mark will have
2/3x + x/3 = 75. So 3/4x + x/2 = 2/3x + x/3. This simplifies to x/12 = 0, which means x = 0. So John has no money.

C.I. = Rs.5000 + Rs.72 = Rs.5072 and S.I. = Rs.5000. So we have C.I. = S.I. + Rs.72. This can be rewritten as
C.I. - S.I. = Rs.72. We also know that C.I. = S.I. + (r/100)(P)(t), where r is the rate of interest, P is the principal, and
t is the time in years. So we have C.I. - S.I. = (r/100)(P)(t). Substituting in the values we know, we have
5072 - 5000 = (r/100)(5000)(2). This simplifies to 72 = (r/100)(10000). So r = 72 * 100 / 10000, which is equal to

So if x is the number of files that were infected by both a virus and a worm, then the number of files that were infected only by a worm is 2.5x. We know that 200 files were infected by a virus, so the number of files that were NOT infected by a virus is 250 - 200 = 50. We also know that the number of files that were infected only by a worm is 2.5x. So 2.5x + 50 = 250. This means that 2.5x = 200, so x = 80.

If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?A)58, B)62, C)66, D)70, E)74",A," The area of a rectangle is length times width. So if the length is 10 meters and the width is 24 meters, then the
area is 240 square meters. If we let x represent the length of the other side, then we have the equation:
10x + 10(24) = 240
10x + 240 = 240
10x = 0
x = 0

248,"What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729.A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39",E," The product of three consecutive integers can be expressed as (x)(x+1)(x+2). So (x)(x+1)(x+2) = 727+728+729. This
simplifies to x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 2160 = 0. Using the quadratic equation, we find that x = -39, -6, or 36. The sum of
three consecutive integers is the middle number plus or minus one, so the sum of three consecutive integers
whose product is 2160 is -6 + 1 = -5, or 36 + 1 = 37. The answer is A.",
