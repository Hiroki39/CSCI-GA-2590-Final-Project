We got (3, 21) from sympy, which means Roger could buy 3 7-dollar toys with the 21 dollars he had left. So the answer is 3.",,
596," Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If each ride cost 4 tickets, how many rides could he go on? ",[3.0],"A: mapping: {x: number of rides Tom could go on}
Tom bought 40 tickets, spent 28 on the 'dunk a clown' booth, and used the rest on rides. Each ride cost 4 tickets.
Eq1: x=(40-28)/4
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,(40-28)/4)

The cafeteria had 75 apples, but handed out 19 to students, leaving 75-19 for pies.
Eq1: x=(75-19)//8
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,(75-19)//8)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 7 from sympy, so the cafeteria could make 7 pies.",,[7.0]

Sarah baked 38 cupcakes, but Todd ate 14 of them. So, Sarah has 38-14 cupcakes left. She wants to put 8 cupcakes in each package.
Eq1: x=(38-14)/8
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns

599, Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? ,[2.0],"A: mapping: {x: number of pictures in one album, y: number of pictures in the other album}
Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. Let's say she put x pictures in one album and y pictures in the other album. We know that x + y = 41 - 37 = 4.
Eq1: x + y = 4
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x, y = symbols('x y')
Eq1 = Eq(x + y, 4)
print(solve((Eq1), (x, y)))
We got {x: 2 - y} from sympy, which means there are infinitely many solutions. One possible solution is x = 1 and y = 3, which means there were 1 picture in one album and 3 pictures in the other album.",,
