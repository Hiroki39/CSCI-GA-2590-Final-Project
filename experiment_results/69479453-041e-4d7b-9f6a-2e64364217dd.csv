Let's use 'j' to represent the number of apples Jackie has.
Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has j+4 apples.
Together, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so j+(j+4)=14
Simplifying the equation, we get 2j+4=14
Solving for j, we get j=5
So Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has j+4=9 apples.
Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so Bob has 5+9+6=20 apples.
