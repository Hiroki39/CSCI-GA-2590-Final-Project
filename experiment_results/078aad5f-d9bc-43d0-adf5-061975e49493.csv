0,Each pack of dvds costs 76 dollars. If there is a discount of 25 dollars on each packHow much do you have to pay to buy each pack?,51.0,"A: mapping:{x:total cost of each pack}
Each pack of DVDs costs 76 dollars. With a discount of 25 dollars, the cost of each pack will be 76 - 25.
Eq1: x = 76 - 25
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,76-25)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 51 from sympy, so the answer is 51.",,51.0
1,Dan had $ 3 left with him after he bought a candy bar. If he had $ 4 at the startHow much did the candy bar cost?,1.0,"A: mapping:{x:cost of the candy bar}
Dan had 4 dollars at the start and had 3 dollars left after buying a candy bar.
Eq1: 4 - x = 3
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(4-x,3)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 1 from sympy, so the candy bar cost 1 dollar.",,1.0
