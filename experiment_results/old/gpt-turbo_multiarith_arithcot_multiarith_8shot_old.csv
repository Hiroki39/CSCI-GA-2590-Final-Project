x = c0 - c1

2. Divide the number of cupcakes left by the number of cupcakes per package to calculate the number of packages she can make.
answer = x / c2","{'c0': 38.0, 'c1': 14.0, 'c2': 8.0}",3.0,"['x = c0 - c1', 'answer = x / c2']"
599, Nancy uploaded c0 pictures to Facebook. She put c1 pics into one album and put the rest into c2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? ,2.0,"Solve the problem step by step:

1. Subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures to calculate the number of pictures left to be put in other albums. Let x be the number of pictures left,
x = c0 - c1

2. Divide the number of pictures left by the number of other albums to calculate the number of pictures in each album.
answer = x / c2","{'c0': 41.0, 'c1': 37.0, 'c2': 2.0}",2.0,"['x = c0 - c1', 'answer = x / c2']"
