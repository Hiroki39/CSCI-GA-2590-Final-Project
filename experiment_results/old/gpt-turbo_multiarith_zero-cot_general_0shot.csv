Next, we need to figure out how many points were scored by the other players. We know that everyone else scored 6 points each, so we can set up an equation: 

6x = total points - 45 

where x is the number of other players on the team. 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

6x = 75 - 45 

6x = 30 

x = 5 

So there were 5 other players on Bianca's team. 

To check our answer, we can add up all the points:
