We also know that the total number of pieces of gum is 41. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
c0 + c1 = 41
We don't have enough information to solve for c0 and c1 separately, but we can use the fact that c0 represents the number of pieces of gum in each package. If we divide both sides of the equation by c0, we get:

We can rearrange this to solve for c0:
c0 = 41 / (1 + (c1/c0))
We still don't know the value of c1/c0, but we can make some reasonable assumptions. For example, we know that c0 must be a positive integer, so c1/c0 must also be a positive number (since c1 is positive).

To do this, we divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds they put in each flower bed: 
flower_beds = c0 / c1
Then, we can find out how many flowers grew by multiplying the number of flower beds by the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each bed: 
total_flowers = flower_beds * c2
The answer is total_flowers.","{'c0': 55.0, 'c1': 15.0, 'c2': 60.0}",220.0,"['flower_beds =  c0 / c1', 'total_flowers =  flower_beds * c2', 'answer = total_flowers']"
