This doesn't make sense, so we need to adjust our approach. 

Let's start with Jill's number of peaches as the unknown variable, x. Then we know that Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, so Steven has x + 11 peaches. And we also know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has (x + 11) - 12 = x - 1 peaches.

Again, this doesn't make sense, so we need to adjust our approach. Let's try working backwards from the information we're given about Jake: he has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, and he has x - 1 peaches. 

So we can set up an equation: 

x - 1 = (Steven's peaches) - 12 

We're given that Steven has 4 peaches, so we can substitute that in:

x = -7

To find out how many days she drank for, we divide the total number of bottles she drank by the number of bottles she drank per day: 144 ÷ X = Y, where X is the number of days and Y is the number of bottles per day. Solving for X, we get X = 144 ÷ Y. We don't know Y, but we know that X is a whole number. The factors of 144 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 144.

774,Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.How many apples does He have?,21.0,"Let's start by using algebra to solve this problem. 

Let A be the number of apples Adam has, and J be the number of apples Jackie has. 

We know that A + J = 12 (since together they have 12 apples). 

We also know that He (let's call him H) has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so H = A + J + 9. 

Finally, we know that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, so A = J + 8. 

We can use substitution to solve for J: 

A + J = 12 

(J + 8) + J = 12 

2J + 8 = 12 

2J = 4 

J = 2 

So Jackie has 2 apples. We can use this to find Adam's number of apples: 

A = J + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10 

Now we can use these values to find H: 

H = A + J + 9 = 10 + 2 + 9 = 21

We know that Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up an equation: 

Ed = Doug + 24 

We also know that Doug lost 27 marbles, so we can subtract that from his original amount: 

Doug - 27 

And we know that Ed found 9 more marbles, so we can add that to his original amount: 

Ed + 9 

Now we can set up an equation to solve for how many marbles Ed had compared to Doug after these changes: 

Ed + 9 = Doug - 27 + 24 

Simplifying this equation: 

Ed + 9 = Doug - 3 

We can substitute the first equation we set up for Ed: 

Doug + 24 + 9 = Doug - 3 

Simplifying: 

Doug + 33 = Doug - 3

We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so we can write:

A = J + 4

We also know that together they have 14 apples, so we can write:

A + J = 14

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

(J + 4) + J = 14

Simplifying, we get:

2J + 4 = 14

2J = 10

J = 5

So Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has 9 apples (since A = J + 4). Together they have 14 apples, so Bob must have 20 apples (since he has 6 more than Adam and Jackie together). The answer is 20.",,20.0

6 + 8 = 13 + x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

14 = x

So Mary already put in 14 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she already put in from the total amount needed:

6 - 14 = -8

Mary has already put in more flour than she needs, so she doesn't need to add any more. The answer is 0.",,0.0

563 + 558 = 1121 (total crayons given away or lost)
332 + 1121 = 1453 (total crayons he started with)

So Paul must have received 1453 - X crayons for his birthday, where X is the number of crayons he gave away. We don't know X, but we can solve for it by setting up an equation: 

1453 - X = number of crayons he started with (which we know is the number he got for his birthday)

Simplifying: 

X = 1453 - number of crayons he got for his birthday

We don't know the exact number of crayons he got for his birthday, but we do know that it's less than or equal to 1453 (since he gave some away and lost some). So the answer is that Paul got somewhere between 0 and 1453 crayons for his birthday.",,1453.0

984,Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. He also earns $ 939 per week for working overtime. If he works overtime every weekHow much money does he earn during harvest season?,1054997.0,"To calculate Lewis' earnings during harvest season, we need to multiply his regular weekly earnings by the number of weeks he works: 

Regular weekly earnings = $28
Number of weeks worked = 1091
Regular earnings during harvest season = $28 x 1091 = $30,548

In addition to his regular earnings, Lewis also earns $939 per week for working overtime. So we need to multiply his overtime earnings by the number of weeks he works: 

Overtime earnings per week = $939
Number of weeks worked = 1091
Overtime earnings during harvest season = $939 x 1091 = $1,024,149

To find Lewis' total earnings during harvest season, we add his regular earnings and his overtime earnings: 

Total earnings during harvest season = $30,548 + $1,024,149 = $1,054,697

Therefore, Lewis earns $1,054,697 during harvest season if he works overtime every week.",,697.0
