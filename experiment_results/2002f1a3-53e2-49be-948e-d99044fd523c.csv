0," For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left? ",39.0,".
A: mapping:{x:pieces left in total} 
Originally, Debby had 32 pieces of candy. Her sister had 42. So in total they had 32 + 42. After eating 35, they
had 32 + 42 - 35. 
Eq1: x=32 + 42 - 35 
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,32 + 42 - 35)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 39 from sympy, so the answer is 39.",,39.0,1
1, A pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. During a sale they sold 10 cats. How many cats do they have left? ,8.0,"
A: mapping:{x: cats left}
The pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats. They sold 10 cats in total. So they have 13 + 5 - 10 left. 
Eq1: 13 + 5 - 10 = x 
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(13 + 5 - 10, x)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 8 from sympy, so the answer is 8.",,8.0,1
