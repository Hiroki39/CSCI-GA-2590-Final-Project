Let's say the number of boys in the school is x. Then the number of girls in the school is x + 458 (since there are 458 more girls than boys). We also know that there are 692 girls in the school. So we can set up an equation:

x + 458 = 692

Subtracting 458 from both sides, we get:

x = 234

So there are 234 boys in the school. To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of boys and girls:

26,Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participateHow many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?,488.0,"The number of students who participated in the suggestion of new food items is the sum of those who suggested mashed potatoes, those who suggested bacon, and those who did not participate. 

So, 

Number of students who participated = Number who suggested mashed potatoes + Number who suggested bacon + Number who did not participate 
Number of students who participated = 450 + 38 + (Total number of students - (450 + 38)) 
Number of students who participated = 450 + 38 + (66 - 450 - 38)

After giving some to Jeff, she has 415 cards left, so she gave away 665 - 415 = 250 cards.
Let's say she gave away x baseball cards and y Ace cards.
We know that x + y = 250 and that she now has 415 cards left, so:
309 - x + 356 - y = 415
Simplifying this equation, we get:
665 - x - y = 415
250 = x + y
Substituting x + y = 250 into the first equation, we get:

120,Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homeworkHow many pages of reading homework did she have to complete?,3.0,"Let's call the number of pages of reading homework Rachel had to complete ""r"". We know that she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework, so she had to complete r + 4 pages of math homework. 

We also know that she had to complete a total of 7 pages of math homework and reading homework combined. So we can set up an equation: 

r + (r + 4) = 7 

Simplifying this equation: 

2r + 4 = 7 

Subtracting 4 from both sides: 

2r = 3 

Dividing both sides by 2: 

r = 1.5 

So Rachel had to complete 1.5 pages of reading homework. However, since you can't complete half a page of homework, we can round up to say that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework.",,2.0,1

Let's try a different approach. If Marco and his dad picked 4 pounds of strawberries together, and Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds, then his dad's strawberries must have weighed 4 - 19 = -15 pounds. 

But this still doesn't make sense. We know that his dad's strawberries can't weigh a negative amount. So let's try one more time. 

If Marco and his dad picked 4 pounds of strawberries together, and Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds, then his dad's strawberries must have weighed 4 - 19 = -15 pounds. 

However, we know that his dad's strawberries can't weigh a negative amount. So we need to flip the numbers around. If Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds and together they picked 4 pounds, then his dad's strawberries must have weighed 4 - 19 = -15 pounds. 

But we know that his dad's strawberries can't weigh a negative amount, so we need to take the absolute value of -15, which is 15. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds and his dad's strawberries weighed 15 pounds. 

To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we subtract:

Then, according to the problem, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x + 19 marbles. After Ed loses some marbles, he has 8 more than Doug, so Ed has x + 8 marbles. We can set up the equation:

x + 19 - y = x + 8

where y is the number of marbles Ed lost. We can simplify this equation by subtracting x from both sides:

19 - y = 8

92 students ÷ 46 buses = 2 students per bus 

Since we know that all buses are full, we can assume that each bus has the same number of seats. Therefore, each bus must have 2 students per seat. 

To find out the total number of seats in each bus, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus: 

92 students ÷ (46 buses x 2 students per bus) = 1 seat per bus 

So each bus has 1 seat. However, this answer doesn't make sense, since we know that there are multiple students per bus. Therefore, we must have made an error in our calculations. 

Let's try a different approach. We know that there are 92 students in the school, and we can assume that each classroom has the same number of students. Therefore, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms: 

92 students ÷ 17 classrooms ≈ 5.41 students per classroom 

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we can round up to the nearest whole number: 

5.41 students per classroom ≈ 6 students per classroom 

Now we know that each classroom has approximately 6 students. If we assume that each bus is assigned to a single classroom, we can calculate the number of seats per bus based on the number of students in that classroom: 

6 students per classroom ÷ 1 student per seat = 6 seats per bus

773,Katie had 62 new games and 80 old games. Her friends had 73 new games and 41 old games.How many old games do they have 3,121.0,"Katie has a total of 142 games (62 new + 80 old). Her friends have a total of 114 games (73 new + 41 old). To find out how many old games they have in total, we need to subtract the number of new games from the total number of games. 

So, Katie and her friends have a total of 235 games (142 + 114). And they have a total of 135 new games (62 + 73). 

To find out how many old games they have, we can subtract the number of new games from the total number of games:

774,Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.How many apples does He have?,21.0,"Let's start by using variables to represent the number of apples each person has. Let A be the number of apples Adam has, J be the number of apples Jackie has, and H be the number of apples he has. 

From the first sentence, we know that: 

A + J = 12 

From the second sentence, we know that: 

H = A + J + 9 

From the third sentence, we know that: 

A = J + 8 

Now we can substitute the third equation into the first equation to get: 

(J + 8) + J = 12 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

2J + 8 = 12 

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: 

2J = 4 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 

J = 2 

Now we can use this value of J to find A: 

A = J + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10 

And we can use both A and J to find H: 

H = A + J + 9 = 10 + 2 + 9 = 21 

Therefore, he has 21 apples.",,21.0,1
