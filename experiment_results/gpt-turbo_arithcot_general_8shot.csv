2. Divide the number of apples left for pies by the number of apples needed for each pie to calculate the number of pies that can be made.
answer = x / c2","{'c0': 75.0, 'c1': 19.0, 'c2': 8.0}",7,"['x = c0 - c1', 'answer = x / c2']",1
598," Sarah baked c0 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate c1 of them how many packages could she make if she put c2 cupcake in each package? ",3,"Solve the problem step by step:
1. Subtract the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the number of cupcakes Sarah baked to calculate the number of cupcakes left. Let x be the number of cupcakes left,
x = c0 - c1
2. Divide the number of cupcakes left by the number of cupcakes in each package to calculate the number of packages she can make.

599, Nancy uploaded c0 pictures to Facebook. She put c1 pics into one album and put the rest into c2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? ,2,"Solve the problem step by step:
1. Subtract the number of pictures in the album from the total number of pictures to calculate the number of pictures in the other albums. Let x be the number of pictures in the other albums,
x = c0 - c1
2. Divide the number of pictures in the other albums by the number of different albums to calculate the number of pictures in each album.
answer = x / c2","{'c0': 41.0, 'c1': 37.0, 'c2': 2.0}",2,"['x = c0 - c1', 'answer = x / c2']",1
