1,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?",E," Let x represent the original price of the item.

The original price of the item is discounted 22%.

x * 0.78 = y

A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon.

y - 20 = z

There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought.

z = 1.90 + (1/2)x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 10.80

The original price of the item was $10.80.",
