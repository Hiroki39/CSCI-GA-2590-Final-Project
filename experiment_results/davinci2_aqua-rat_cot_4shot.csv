How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?Answer Choices: A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168",E," The ratio of boys to girls in the group is 4:3. So if x is the number of boys who joined, then 3x is the number of girls who joined. So 4x + 3x = x + 3x = 100. So x = 25. So there are now 64 + 25 = 89 boys and 40 + 75 = 115 girls.

100,"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.Answer Choices: A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200",B," Let the length of the sheet be x cm and the width be y cm.

When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter is 2x + 2y = 48.

When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter is 2x + 2y = 66.

This means that x + y = 36.

Now we can plug this value of x + y into either equation to solve for x or y.

2x + 2y = 48
2x + 2(36) = 48
2x = 12
x = 6

Now we know that the length of the sheet is 6 cm. We can plug this value into either equation to solve for y.

2x + 2y = 66
2(6) + 2y = 66
12 + 2y = 66
2y = 54
y = 27

Now we know that the width of the sheet is 27 cm.

The area of the sheet is 6 cm * 27 cm = 162 cm^2.

The answer is C.",

If 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, then the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected was 2/100 * (0.1x - y) = 0.002x - 0.0002y. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, then 0.002x - 0.0002y = 72. This simplifies to 0.002x = 72 + 0.0002y. So x = 36,000 + y. If the total number of staplers produced was 0.1x = 10/100 * (36,000 + y) = 3,600 + 0.1y, then the total number of staplers produced was 3,600 + 0.1y + y = 3,600 + 1.1y. So 1.1y = 72. So y = 72/1.1 = 65.45. So the total number of staplers produced was 3,600 + 1.1y = 3,600 + 1.1(65.45) = 3,600 + 72 = 3,672. The answer is B.",

251,"Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for whichAnswer Choices: A)L(x,y) = R(x,y), B)L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y), C)L(x,y) < R(x,y), D)L(x,y) < R(x,y), E)None",D," L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]
R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]

For L(x,y) = R(x,y) to be true, we need [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y]

However, this is not possible as the left side is always less than or equal to the right side.

The answer is B.",
252,"A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?Answer Choices: A)36 grams, B)40 grams, C)42 grams, D)48 grams, E)50 grams",B," The weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver. This means that the weight of the aluminum in the alloy is 15 grams. The weight of the silver in the alloy is 30 - 15 = 15 grams. If silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, then the weight of the silver in the alloy is 2 * 15 = 30 grams. The weight of the aluminum in the alloy is 30 - 30 = 0 grams. The weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum would be 0 grams. The answer is A.",
