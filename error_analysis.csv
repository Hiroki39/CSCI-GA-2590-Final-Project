554," Katie's team won their dodgeball game and scored 12 points total. If Katie scored 4 of the points and everyone else scored 4 points each, how many players were on her team? ",2,3,3,3,3,"{'c0': 12.0, 'c1': 4.0, 'c2': 4.0}","Katie scored 4 points and everyone else scored 4 points each, so the number of players on her team can be found by dividing the total points by the points per player: 

12 - 4 = 8 (points scored by everyone else)
8 / 4 = 2 

There were 2 players (besides Katie) on her team. So the total number of players on her team is 2 + 1 (Katie) = 3. The answer is 3.","Solve the problem step by step:

1. Subtract Katie's points from the total points to calculate the total points scored by the other players. Let x be the total points scored by the other players,
x = c0 - c1

2. Divide the total points scored by the other players by the points each player scored to calculate the number of players on the team. Let y be the number of players on the team,
y = x / c2

3. Add 1 to the number of players on the team to include Katie.
answer = y + 1","Katie's team scored c0 points total. Katie scored c1 of those points, so the rest of the team scored c0 - c1 points. Each of the other players scored c2 points, so the number of other players is (c0 - c1) / c2. 

The total number of players on the team is the number of other players plus Katie, so the answer is (c0 - c1) / c2 + 1."
570," Paige picked 53 flowers for her friend���������s wedding. She was making bouquets with 7 flowers in each one. If 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquet",5,5,12,5,5,"{'c0': 53.0, 'c1': 7.0, 'c2': 18.0}","Paige picked 53 flowers. She was making bouquets with 7 flowers in each one, so she could make 53/7 = 7.57 bouquets. Since she can't make a partial bouquet, she can only make 7 bouquets. 18 of the flowers wilted, so she has 53-18 = 35 flowers left. She can make 35/7 = 5 bouquets with the remaining flowers. In total, she can make 7+5 = 12 bouquets. The answer is 12.","Solve the problem step by step:

1. Divide the total number of flowers picked by the number of flowers in each bouquet to calculate the total number of bouquets. Let x be the total number of bouquets,
x = c0 / c1

2. Subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers to calculate the number of usable flowers. Let y be the number of usable flowers,
y = c0 - c2

3. Divide the number of usable flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet to calculate the number of bouquets she can still make.
answer = y / c1","Paige picked c0 flowers. She was making bouquets with c1 flowers in each one. So she could make c0/c1 bouquets. 
bouquets_possible = c0/c1

If c2 flowers wilted, then she has c0 - c2 flowers left. She can make (c0 - c2)/c1 bouquets. 
bouquets_remaining = (c0 - c2)/c1

The answer is bouquets_remaining."
578, Sarah was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 21 seeds and planted 12 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each.

She planted 3 seeds in each small garden, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 small gardens. The answer is 3.","Solve the problem step by step:

1. Subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the original number of seeds to calculate the number of seeds left for the small gardens. Let x be the number of seeds left for the small gardens,
x = c0 - c1

2. Divide the number of seeds left for the small gardens by the number of seeds planted in each small garden to calculate the number of small gardens. Let y be the number of small gardens,
y = x / c2

3. Round down the number of small gardens to the nearest integer, since you can't have a fraction of a garden.

4. Calculate the answer by adding the number of small gardens to the big garden.
answer = y + 1 (for the big garden)","Sarah planted c1 seeds in the big garden and c2 seeds in each small garden. Let's say she planted s small gardens. Then the total number of seeds planted is c1 + c2*s. But we know that this is equal to c0, the number of seeds she started with. So we can set up an equation:

c1 + c2*s = c0

Solving for s, we get:

s = (c0 - c1) / c2

The answer is s."

So the total number of points scored can be represented as: 

45 + 6x = 75 

Subtracting 45 from both sides: 

6x = 30 

Dividing both sides by 6: 

x = 5 

So there were 5 other players on Bianca's team. Including Bianca, the total number of players on the team is 6. The answer is 6.","Solve the problem step by step:

1. Subtract Bianca's score from the total score to calculate the total score of the other players. Let x be the total score of the other players,
x = c0 - c1

2. Divide the total score of the other players by the score each player got to calculate the number of other players. Let y be the number of other players,
y = x / c2

3. Add 1 to the number of other players to include Bianca and calculate the answer.
answer = y + 1","Bianca scored c1 points and everyone else scored c2 points each. Let's say there were n other players on her team. Then the total number of points scored can be expressed as:

total_points = c1 + n*c2

But we also know that the total number of points scored was c0. So we can set up an equation:

c0 = c1 + n*c2

Solving for n, we get:

n = (c0 - c1) / c2

The answer is n."
