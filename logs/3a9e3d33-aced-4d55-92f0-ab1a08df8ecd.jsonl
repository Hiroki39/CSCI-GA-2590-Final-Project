{"question": "The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 39 inches. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog.How far did the mouse jump?", "answer": [8.0], "response": "The grasshopper jumped 39 inches. Let's call the distance the frog jumped \"x\". Then the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper jumped x + 19 inches. The mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse jumped x - 12 inches. We know that the total distance jumped is the sum of all three distances: 39 + x + (x + 19) + (x - 12) = 3x + 46. We don't know the value of x, but we do know that the total distance jumped was 39 inches. So we can set the equation equal to 39 and solve for x: 3x + 46 = 39. Subtracting 46 from both sides gives 3x = -7, and dividing by 3 gives x = -7/3. This doesn't make sense as a distance, so we made an error somewhere. Let's check our work. We know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so x + 19 = 39. Solving for x gives x = 20. We can check this by plugging in x = 20 to the other equations: the grasshopper jumped 39 inches (20 + 19), and the mouse jumped 8 inches (20 - 12). So the mouse jumped 8 inches.
