If 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, then the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected was 2/100 * (0.1x - y) = 0.002x - 0.0002y. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, then 0.002x - 0.0002y = 72. This simplifies to 0.002x = 72 + 0.0002y. So x = 36,000 + y. If the total number of staplers produced was 0.1x = 10/100 * (36,000 + y) = 3,600 + 0.1y, then the total number of staplers produced was 3,600 + 0.1y + y = 3,600 + 1.1y. So 1.1y = 72.
