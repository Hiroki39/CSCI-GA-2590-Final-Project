{"question": "A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?", "answer": "A", "response": "\nAnswer Choices: (a) 10 minutes (b) 15 minutes (c) 20 minutes (d) 25 minutes (e) 30 minutes\nA: mapping:{x:the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower}\nEq1: x=10+15\n# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns\nfrom sympy import *\nx = symbols('x')\nEq1 = Eq(x,10+15)\nprint(solve(Eq1,x))\nWe got 25 from Sympy, so the answer is d.", "mapping": ""}
