{"question": "The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?", "answer": "E", "response": " Let x represent the original price of the item.\n\nThe original price of the item is discounted 22%.\n\nThis means that the new price, after the discount, is 78% of the original price.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n0.78x = new price\n\nThe customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon.\n\nThis means that the customer pays $20 less than the new price.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n0.78x - 20 = final price paid by customer\n\nThere is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought.\n\nThis means that the final price paid by the customer is equal to the total amount spent.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n0.78x - 20 = 1.90 + 0.5x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 50\n\nThe original price of the item was $50.", "mapping": ""}
