", "answer": [8.0], "response": "To find the number of players on Emily's team, we need to subtract her points from the total points and then divide by the number of points each other player scored. \n\nFirst, we subtract Emily's 23 points from the total of 39: \n\n39 - 23 = 16 \n\nThis means that the rest of the team scored a total of 16 points. \n\nNext, we divide the 16 points by the 2 points each player scored (besides Emily): \n\n16 \u00f7 2 = 8 \n\nSo there were 8 other players on Emily's team. \n\nTo find the total number of players, we add Emily (who scored 23) to the 8 other players (who each scored 2): \n\n23 + (8 x 2) = 23 + 16 = 39 \n\nSo there were 9 players on Emily's team.", "mapping": ""}
