So, the perimeter of each part will be 2(l/2 + w) = l + 2w. We are given that this is equal to 48cm, so:\nEq1: l + 2w = 48\nSimilarly, when folded along the other set of sides, each part will have a length of w/2 and a width of l. So, the perimeter of each part will be 2(w/2 + l) = w + 2l. We are given that this is equal to 66cm, so:\nEq2: w + 2l = 66\nTo find the area of the rectangular sheet, we can use the formula A = lw.

Since the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, we have:\n2x + 2y + 9 = 2(x + y + 4.5)\n2x + 2y + 9 = 2x + 2y + 9\nThis means that the perimeter of the rectangle is unchanged by painting three of its sides. Therefore, we can use the given sum of the lengths of the painted sides to solve for x and y:\n2x + y = 37\ny = 37 - 2x\nSubstituting this into Eq2, we get:\nx(37 - 2x) = A\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\n-2x^2 + 37x = A\nTo maximize the area, we need to find the vertex of the parabola given by this equation. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:\nx = -b/2a = -37/(2*(-2)) = 9.25\nSubstituting this back into the equation, we get:\nA = -2(9.25)^2 + 37(9.25) = 81\nTherefore, the area of the parking space is 81 square feet, which corresponds to answer choice B.", "mapping": ""}

{"question": "Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?A)4, B)5, C)6, D)7, E)8", "answer": "B", "response": "A: mapping:{x:the time it takes for both P and Q to empty the jar}\nP can eat the entire jar in 10 minutes, so his rate of eating is 1/10 of the jar per minute.\nQ can eat half the jar in 5 minutes, so her rate of eating is 1/10 of the jar per minute.\nWhen they eat together, their combined rate of eating is the sum of their individual rates.\nEq1: x/(1/10 + 1/5) = 1\n# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns\nfrom sympy import *\nx = symbols('x')\nEq1 = Eq(x/(1/10 + 1/5),1)\nprint(solve(Eq1,x))\nWe got 6 from Sympy, so the answer is C.", "mapping": ""}
{"question": "A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?A)125, B)150, C)225, D)250, E)275", "answer": "A", "response": "Mapping: \nLet P be the total profit made by the grocery.\nLet C be the cost of producing one bag of ice.\nLet S be the selling price of one bag of ice.\n\nEq1: P = 500*(S-C)\nEq2: S = 1.25*1.2\nEq3: C = 1.25\n\nSubstituting Eq2 and Eq3 into Eq1, we get:\nP = 500*(1.25*1.2 - 1.25)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\nP = 500*0.25\n\nTherefore, P = $125, so the answer is A.", "mapping": ""}
