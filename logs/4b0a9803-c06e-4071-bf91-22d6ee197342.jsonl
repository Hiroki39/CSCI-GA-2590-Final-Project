{"question": " In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 8 points. If a level has 7 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn? ", "answer": [40.0], "response": "First, we need to figure out how many enemies were defeated. To do this, we can subtract the number of enemies remaining from the total number of enemies: \n\n7 total enemies - 2 remaining enemies = 5 defeated enemies \n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of points earned for defeating these enemies. Each defeated enemy is worth 8 points, so we can multiply the number of defeated enemies by 8: \n\n5 defeated enemies x 8 points per enemy = 40 points \n\nTherefore, if you destroy all but 2 of the 7 enemies in the level, you would earn 40 points.", "mapping": ""}

We know she used 6 cups of flour for each brownie, so: \n\n7 brownies already baked x 6 cups of flour per brownie = 42 cups of flour used \n\nFinally, we can calculate how much more flour Chloe needs by multiplying the number of brownies she still needs to bake by the amount of flour per brownie: \n\n9 more brownies needed x 6 cups of flour per brownie = 54 cups of flour still needed \n\nTherefore, Chloe still needs 54 cups of flour to bake the remaining brownies for her party.", "mapping": ""}
