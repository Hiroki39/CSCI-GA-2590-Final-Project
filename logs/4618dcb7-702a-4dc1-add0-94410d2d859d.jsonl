{"question": "Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homeworkHow many pages did she have to complete in all?", "answer": [13.0], "response": "Rachel had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework, so let's call the number of pages of reading homework she had to complete \"x\". This means she had to complete x + 3 pages of math homework. In total, she had to complete x + (x + 3) = 2x + 3 pages of homework. Since we know she had to complete 8 pages of math homework, we can set up the equation 2x + 3 = 8 and solve for x. Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us 2x = 5, and dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 2.5. However, since Rachel can't complete half a page of homework, we know she actually had to complete 3 pages of reading homework (the closest whole number to 2.5). Therefore, she had to complete 3 + 8 = 11 pages of homework in all. The answer is 11.", "mapping": ""}

This means:\n\n11 * 2 = 22 eggs in each group\n\nSo the total number of groups is:\n\nx / 22\n\nAnd we want this to be a whole number, since we can't have a fraction of a group. So we can set up an equation:\n\nx / 22 = n, where n is a whole number\n\nMultiplying both sides by 22, we get:\n\nx = 22n\n\nSo the total number of eggs must be a multiple of 22. We don't know the exact number of eggs, but we know it must be a multiple of 22.", "mapping": ""}

To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she already put in from the total amount needed:\n\n6 - 14 = -8\n\nMary has already put in more flour than she needs, so she doesn't need to add any more.

If he works overtime every weekHow much money does he earn during harvest season?", "answer": [1054997.0], "response": "To calculate Lewis' earnings during harvest season, we need to multiply his regular weekly earnings by the number of weeks he works: \n\nRegular weekly earnings = $28\nNumber of weeks worked = 1091\nRegular earnings during harvest season = $28 x 1091 = $30,548\n\nIn addition to his regular earnings, Lewis also earns $939 per week for working overtime. So we need to multiply his overtime earnings by the number of weeks he works: \n\nOvertime earnings per week = $939\nNumber of weeks worked = 1091\nOvertime earnings during harvest season = $939 x 1091 = $1,024,149\n\nTo find Lewis' total earnings during harvest season, we add his regular earnings and his overtime earnings: \n\nTotal earnings during harvest season = $30,548 + $1,024,149 = $1,054,697\n\nTherefore, Lewis earns $1,054,697 during harvest season if he works overtime every week.", "mapping": ""}
