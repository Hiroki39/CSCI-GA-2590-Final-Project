It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498", "answer": "A", "response": "The total number of smaller cubes in the hollow cube is (5-2)^3 = 27*1 = 27. The number of smaller cubes on the surface of the hollow cube is (5*5*6) - (3*3*6) = 150. Each of these smaller cubes has 5 faces that need to be painted. So the total number of faces that need to be painted is 150*5 = 750. The number of faces that remain unpainted is the total number of faces of the smaller cubes minus the number of faces that need to be painted, which is 27*6 - 750 = 162 - 750 = 588. However, we need to subtract the number of faces that are on the inside of the hollow cube, which is 27*1*6 = 162. So the final answer is 588 - 162 = 426.

{"question": "The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?A)47, B)91, C)41, D)67, E)44", "answer": "C", "response": "Let's start by finding the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n\nsum = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 5 (since there are 5 numbers), and they are consecutive odd numbers, so d = 2. We can let the first number be x, so the five numbers are x, x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nsum = (5/2)(2x + 4(2))\nsum = 5x + 20\n\nNow we need to find which of these sums, when divided by 10, is a perfect square. Let's try each answer choice:\n\nA) 47: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 47 is 235. When we divide this by 10, we get 23.5, which is not a perfect square.\n\nB) 91: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 91 is 455. When we divide this by 10, we get 45.5, which is not a perfect square.\n\nC) 41: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 41 is 205. When we divide this by 10, we get 20.5, which is not a perfect square.\n\nD) 67: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 67 is 335. When we divide this by 10, we get 33.5, which is not a perfect square.\n\nE) 44: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 44 is 225. When we divide this by 10, we get 22.5, which is not a perfect square.\n\nNone of the answer choices work! But we can still solve the problem by using algebra. We know that the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is 5x + 20, and we want this to be a perfect square when divided by 10. So we can write:\n\n(5x + 20)/10 = k^2\n\nwhere k is some integer. Simplifying, we get:\n\nx + 4 = 2k^2\n\nThis tells us that x+4 must be an even perfect square (since 2k^2 is always even). The only two-digit even perfect squares are 16, 36, 64, and 100. Trying each of these, we find that only 36 works:\n\nx+4 = 36\nx = 32\n\nSo the five consecutive odd numbers are 32, 34, 36, 38, and 40. The answer is not one of the answer choices given.", "mapping": ""}

After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions x-4 and x. The area of this rectangle is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x. Cutting this rectangle diagonally in half creates two congruent right triangles, each with legs x-4 and x/2. The area of each triangle is (1/2)(x-4)(x/2) = 70, which simplifies to x^2 - 8x - 280 = 0.\n\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula, we get x = 18 or x = -10. Since x represents a length, we discard the negative solution and conclude that the original side length of the square piece of cloth was 18 feet.

So we need to adjust our answer accordingly. One way to do this is to assume that the fixed part of the bill is proportional to the number of days in the month, and then use the ratio of days to adjust the fixed part. For example, if the month with 540 calls had 30 days and the month with 500 calls had 28 days, then we can adjust the fixed part as follows:\nNew fixed part = 1260 x (28/30) = 1176\nSo the adjusted bill would be:\nBill = 1176 + 3(500) = Rs. 2166\nThis is not one of the answer choices, so we may have made an error in our assumptions or calculations.

So we made a mistake somewhere. Looking back at our calculations, we see that we assumed there were 100 employees in the company, but we don't actually know the total number of employees. \n\nLet's represent the total number of employees with \"T\".

Then:\n\n0.8T - 0.75T = 5% of T take only a summer vacation = 0.05T\n0.4T = 0.75T - 0.05T + 0.2T + x\n0.4T = 0.9T + x\nx = -0.5T\n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense - we can't have negative employees! So we made another mistake somewhere. Looking back at our calculations, we see that we assumed that the employees who take both vacations are included in the employees who take a winter vacation. But this is not necessarily true - some of the employees who take both vacations may not take a winter vacation. \n\nLet's represent the number of employees who take both vacations with \"y\". Then:\n\n75% of T take a winter vacation = 0.75T\n40% of T take both vacations = y\n20% of T take neither vacation = 0.2T\n100% - 20% = 80% take at least one vacation = 0.8T\n\nTo find the number of employees who take only a summer vacation, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal employees who take summer vacation - Employees who take both vacations = Employees who take only summer vacation\n\nLet's represent the number of employees who take only a summer vacation with \"x\". Then:\n\n0.8T - 0.75T = 5% of T take only a summer vacation = 0.05T\ny + x = 0.4T\n0.2T = 0.75T - y + x\n0.2T = 0.35T + x - y\n\nNow we have three equations and three variables. We can solve for \"x\" by eliminating \"y\" from the last two equations:\n\n0.2T = 0.35T + x - y\ny = 0.35T + x - 0.2T\ny = 0.15T + x\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\ny + x = 0.4T\n(0.15T + x) + x = 0.4T\n2x = 0.1T\nx = 0.05T\n\nSo 5% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

{"question": "If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ?A)3267, B)2678, C)2797, D)2300, E)2781", "answer": "D", "response": "First, we need to find the number of eligible voters. 20% of 5,000 is 1,000, so there are 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000 eligible voters. \n\nNext, we need to find the number of votes the winning candidate received. If they won by 15%, that means they received 50% + 15% = 65% of the votes. \n\nTo find the actual number of votes, we multiply the percentage by the total number of eligible voters: \n\n0.65 x 4,000 = 2,600 \n\nTherefore, the winning candidate received 2,600 votes.

{"question": "For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0", "answer": "C", "response": "Let's assume the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins. \nAccording to the problem, the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. \nSo, the total amount earned by the diver can be expressed as: \n20x + 25y = 340 cents \nWe need to find the minimum number of copper coins, which means we need to minimize the value of x. \nLet's try to simplify the equation above: \n20x + 25y = 340 \n4x + 5y = 68 \nWe know that x and y are both integers, so we need to find two integers that satisfy the equation above. \nOne way to do this is to start with y = 0 and keep increasing it until we find a valid solution. \nIf y = 0, then 4x = 68, which means x = 17. This is not a valid solution because the diver needs to bring at least one brass coin to earn some money. \nIf y = 1, then 4x + 5 = 68, which means 4x = 63 and x = 15.75. This is not a valid solution because x needs to be an integer. \nIf y = 2, then 4x + 10 = 68, which means 4x = 58 and x = 14.5. This is not a valid solution because x needs to be an integer. \nIf y = 3, then 4x + 15 = 68, which means 4x = 53 and x = 13.25. This is not a valid solution because x needs to be an integer. \nIf y = 4, then 4x + 20 = 68, which means 4x = 48 and x = 12. This is a valid solution because x is an integer and y is an integer. \nTherefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 12. Answer choice (A) is correct.", "mapping": ""}

Since Ram and Krishna are traveling towards each other, their combined speed is 20+40=60m/s. They meet at point C after 10 seconds, so the distance between A and C is (20m/s)(10s)=200m and the distance between B and C is (40m/s)(10s)=400m.
