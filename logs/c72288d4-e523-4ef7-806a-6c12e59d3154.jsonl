Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?", "answer": "B", "response": "\nAnswer Choices: (a) 15 (b) 10 (c) 12.5 (d) 20 (e) 25\nA: Mapping: {x: the number of minutes it would take P and Q to finish the jar of candies}\nEq1: x/10 + x/5 = 1\n# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns\nfrom sympy import *\nx = symbols('x')\nEq1 = Eq(x/10 + x/5, 1)\nprint(solve(Eq1,x))\nWe got 12.5 from Sympy, so the answer is c.", "mapping": ""}
