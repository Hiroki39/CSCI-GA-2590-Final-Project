{"question": "A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?A)5(\u221a3 + 1), B)6(\u221a3 + \u221a2), C)7(\u221a3 \u2013 1), D)8(\u221a3 \u2013 2), E)None of these", "answer": "A", "response": " The car is moving in a straight line, so the rate of change of the angle of elevation is constant. Since it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, it will take 5 more minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 60\u00b0 to 75\u00b0. So the car will reach the base of the tower in 15 minutes. The answer is A.", "mapping": ""}
{"question": "The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?A)$61, B)$65, C)$67.40, D)$70, E)$78.20", "answer": "E", "response": " Let x be the original price of the item. Then the discounted price is 0.78x. The customer pays $20 less than this, so\nthe total cost is 0.78x - 20. The customer pays $1.90 more than half the original price, so 0.78x - 20 > 0.5x + 1.90.\nThis simplifies to 0.28x > 21.90. So x > 78.21. The closest option is 78.20, so the answer is e.", "mapping": ""}
