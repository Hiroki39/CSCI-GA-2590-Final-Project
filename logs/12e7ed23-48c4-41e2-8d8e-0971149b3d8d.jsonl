Then the winning candidate received x + 600 votes. \n\nThe total number of votes cast is x + (x + 600) = 2x + 600. \n\nWe know that 4,000 people voted, so: \n\n2x + 600 = 4,000 \n\n2x = 3,400 \n\nx = 1,700 \n\nSo the losing candidate received 1,700 votes and the winning candidate received 2,300 votes (1,700 + 600). \n\nThe answer is D) 2300.", "mapping": ""}
{"question": "For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0", "answer": "C", "response": "Let's assume the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins. Then we can set up the following equations:\n\n- 0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40 (the total amount earned from the dive)\n- x + y = the total number of coins brought up\n\nWe want to find the minimum number of copper coins, so we want to minimize x. We can use substitution to solve for y in terms of x:\n\n- y = (3.40 - 0.20x) / 0.25\n- y = 13.6 - 0.8x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\n- x + (13.6 - 0.8x) = the total number of coins brought up\n- 0.2x + 13.6 = the total number of coins brought up\n\nWe want to minimize x, so we want to maximize the total number of coins brought up. The only way to do this is to have as many brass coins as possible (since they earn more money). So let's assume that all the coins brought up are brass coins:\n\n- 0.25y = 3.40\n- y = 13.6\n\nThis means the diver brought up 13.6 brass coins. Since the diver can only bring up whole coins, the minimum number of copper coins she brought up is:\n\n- x = the total number of coins brought up - y\n- x = 13.6 - 13\n- x = 0.6\n\nSo the minimum number of copper coins the diver brought up is 1 (since she can't bring up 0.6 of a coin).

Since Ram and Krishna are traveling towards each other, their relative speed is 20+40=60m/s. They meet at point C after 10 seconds, so the distance between A and C is (20m/s)(10s)=200m and the distance between B and C is (40m/s)(10s)=400m. Therefore, the total distance between A and B is x=200m+400m=600m. The answer is E.", "mapping": ""}

Then we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nThe time it takes Winson to run to school is d / 10, and the time it takes him to walk home is d / 5. Since the whole journey took one hour, we can set up the equation:\n\nd / 10 + d / 5 = 1\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nd = 6\n\nTherefore, the distance between his home and school is 6 miles.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and sold all of its white golf balls, then it must have sold 240 white golf balls. This means that the store had 360 yellow golf balls to begin the day (600 total golf balls - 240 white golf balls sold). Therefore, the answer is E) 360.", "mapping": ""}
