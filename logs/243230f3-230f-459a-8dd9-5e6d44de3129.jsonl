{"question": "For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0", "answer": "C", "response": "A: mapping:{c: number of copper coins, b: number of brass coins}\nEq1: 20c + 25b = 340 (total amount earned in cents)\nWe need to find the minimum number of copper coins, so we want to minimize the value of c. We can use trial and error to find the answer:\n- If all the coins were brass, she would have earned 25 cents per coin, so she would have brought 13.6/0.25 = 54.4 coins. This is not possible, so we know that there must be at least one copper coin.\n- If there is one copper coin, then there must be 12 brass coins, and she would have earned 20 cents for the copper coin and 12*25 = 300 cents for the brass coins, for a total of 320 cents. This is not enough, so we know that there must be at least two copper coins.\n- If there are two copper coins, then there must be 11 brass coins, and she would have earned 40 cents for the copper coins and 11*25 = 275 cents for the brass coins, for a total of 315 cents. This is still not enough, so we know that there must be at least three copper coins.\n- If there are three copper coins, then there must be 10 brass coins, and she would have earned 60 cents for the copper coins and 10*25 = 250 cents for the brass coins, for a total of 310 cents. This is still not enough, so we know that there must be at least four copper coins.\n- If there are four copper coins, then there must be 9 brass coins, and she would have earned 80 cents for the copper coins and 9*25 = 225 cents for the brass coins, for a total of 305 cents. This is still not enough, so we know that there must be at least five copper coins.\n- If there are five copper coins, then there must be 8 brass coins, and she would have earned 100 cents for the copper coins and 8*25 = 200 cents for the brass coins, for a total of 300 cents. This is exactly the amount she earned, so the answer is 5 copper coins.\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the answer choices given.", "mapping": ""}

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, we know that w/2 white golf balls were sold, which means that w/2 = 480/2 = 240 white golf balls were in stock at the beginning of the day. Therefore, w = 480 white golf balls were in stock at the beginning of the day. Substituting this into the equation y + w = 600, we get y + 240 = 600, so y = 360.

Let's say the weight of an orange is o, the weight of a pineapple is p, the weight of a grape is g, and the weight of a mango is m. Then we can write the following equation:\nEq1: 18o + 27p + 15g = k * m, where k is a constant of proportionality.\nTo find the value of k, we need to know the weight of a mango. Let's assume that the weight of a mango is half the weight of an orange. Then we can write:\nEq2: m = 0.5o\nSubstituting Eq2 into Eq1, we get:\n18o + 27p + 15g = k * 0.5o\nSimplifying, we get:\n36o + 54p + 30g = k * o\nDividing both sides by o, we get:\n36 + 54p/o + 30g/o = k\nSince we know that the cost of a mango is proportional to its weight, we can assume that the cost of a mango is equal to k times its weight. Therefore, we can write:\nmango = k * m = k * 0.5o\nSubstituting the value of k from the previous equation, we get:\nmango = (36 + 54p/o + 30g/o) * 0.5o\nSimplifying, we get:\nmango = 18o + 27p/2 + 15g/2\nTherefore, a mango costs 18 dollars + 27/2 dollars + 15/2 dollars = 36 dollars.
