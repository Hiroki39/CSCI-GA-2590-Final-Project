They put c1 seeds in each flower bed. So they must have planted c0/c1 flower beds. \nflower_beds = c0/c1\nOut of the c1 seeds in each flower bed, only c2 grew into flowers. So they had c2 flowers in each flower bed. Therefore, they had c2 * flower_beds flowers in total. \ntotal_flowers = c2 * flower_beds\nTo find the number of flower beds, we can rearrange the equation for flower_beds: \nflower_beds = c0/c1\nSo the answer is flower_beds.", "mapping": {"c0": 36.0, "c1": 12.0, "c2": 58.0}}
{"question": "At the zoo, a cage had c0 snakes and c1 alligators. If c2 snakes and c3 alligators were hidingHow many alligators were not hiding?", "answer": [56.0], "response": "There were originally c1 alligators in the cage. Some of them were hiding, so the number of alligators not hiding would be c1 - c3. \nalligators_not_hiding = c1 - c3\nThe answer is alligators_not_hiding.", "mapping": {"c0": 3.0, "c1": 75.0, "c2": 82.0, "c3": 19.0}}
{"question": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted c0 seeds. They put c1 seeds in each flower bed and only c2 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.How many flowers did they grow?", "answer": [220.0], "response": "First, we need to find out how many flower beds they planted. To do this, we divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds they put in each flower bed: \nflower_beds = c0 / c1\nThen, we can find out how many flowers grew by multiplying the number of flower beds by the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each bed: \ntotal_flowers = flower_beds * c2\nThe answer is total_flowers.", "mapping": {"c0": 55.0, "c1": 15.0, "c2": 60.0}}
