Q: There are c0 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be c1 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

Information from question:

original_trees = c0
total_trees = c1

1. Subtract the number of original trees from the number of total trees to how many new trees are planted.
new_trees = total_trees - original_trees

answer = new_trees


Q: If there are c0 cars in the parking lot and c1 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

Information from question:

original_cars = c0
new_cars = c1

1. Add the number of original cars and the number of new cars to calculate how many cars are now in the parking lot.
total_cars = original_cars + new_cars

answer = total_cars
