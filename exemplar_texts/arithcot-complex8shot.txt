Q: There are c0 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be c1 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.
A:
Solve the problem step by step:
Information from question:
original_trees = c0
total_trees = c1
1. Subtract the number of original trees from the number of total trees to how many new trees are planted.
new_trees = total_trees - original_trees
answer = new_trees

Q: If there are c0 cars in the parking lot and c1 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.
A:
Solve the problem step by step:
Information from question:
original_cars = c0
new_cars = c1
1. Add the number of original cars and the number of new cars to calculate how many cars are now in the parking lot.
total_cars = original_cars + new_cars
answer = total_cars


Q: Leah had c0 chocolates and her sister had c1. If they ate c2, how many pieces do they have left in total? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.
A:
Solve the problem step by step:
Information from question:
leah_chocolates = c0
sister_chocolates = c1
chocolates_eaten = c2
1. Add the number of chocolates Leah had and the number of chocolates her sister had to calculate the total number of chocolates. Let total_chocolates be the total number of chocolates,
total_chocolates = leah_chocolates + sister_chocolates
2. Subtract the number of chocolates eaten from the total number of chocolates to calculate how many chocolates are left.
chocolates_left = total_chocolates - chocolates_eaten
answer = chocolates_left

Q: Jason had c0 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has c1 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.
A:
Solve the problem step by step:
Information from question:
Jason_original_lollipops = c0
Jason_current_lollipops = c1
1. Subtract the number of lollipops that Jason currently has from the number of lollipops that Jason had before to calculate the number of lollipops given out. 
Jason_given_out = Jason_original_lollipops - Jason_current_lollipops
answer = Jason_given_out

Q: Shawn has c0 toys. For Christmas, he got c1 toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.
A:
Solve the problem step by step:
Information from question:
original_toy = c0
new_toy_from_each_parent = c1
1. Multiply the number of toys Shawn got from each parent by the number of parents. Let total_recieved be the number of toys he recieved in total,
total_recieved = new_toy_from_each_parent  * 2
2. Add the number of toys Shawn got and the number of toys he originally had to calculate the answer.
current_toys = original_toy + total_recieved
answer = current_toys

Q: There were c0 computers in the server room. c1 more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.
A:
Solve the problem step by step:
Information from question:
original_computers = c0
new_computers_per_day = c
1. Multiply the number of new computers installed each day with the total number of days. Let total_new_computers be the total number of computers,
total_new_computers = new_computers_per_day * 4
2. Add the number of computers newly installed and the number of computers originally in the room to calculate the answer.
total_computers = total_new_computers + original_computers 
answer = total_computers

Q: Michael had c0 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost c1 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost c2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.
A:
Solve the problem step by step:
Information from question:
original_golf_balls = c0
lost_golf_balls_tuesday = c1
lost_golf_balls_wednesday = c1
1. Subtract the number of golf balls lost on tuesday from original number of golf balls to calculate the number of golf balls he had on tuesday. Let golf_balls_tuesday be the number of golf balls he had on tuesday,
golf_balls_tuesday = original_golf_balls - lost_golf_balls_tuesday
2. Subtract the number of golf balls lost on wednesday from the number of golf balls on tuesday to calculate the answer.
golf_balls_wednesday = golf_balls_tuesday - lost_golf_balls_wednesday
answer = golf_balls_wednesday

Q: Olivia has $c0. She bought c1 bagels for $c2 each. How much money does she have left? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.
A:
Solve the problem step by step:
Information from question:
original_money = c0
bagels_bought = c1
price_per_bagel = c2
1. Multiply the number of bagels bought by the price of each bagel to calculate the total money spent. Let money_spent be the total money spent,
money_spent = bagels_bought * price_per_bagel
2. Subtract the total money spent from the amount of money she had.
current_money = original_money - money_spent
answer = current_money
