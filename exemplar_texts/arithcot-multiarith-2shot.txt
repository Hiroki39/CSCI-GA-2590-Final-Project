Q: Andy and his brother Aaron received money for holiday. Andy had c0 dollars while his brother had c1. If they spent c2 dollars on a new video game, how many dollars do they have left? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

andy_money = c0
aaron_money = c1
money_spent = c2

1. Sum up their money since they spent money on a new video game together. Let total_money be the total number of dollars they have,
total_money = andy_money + aaron_money

2. Subtract the money spent by them on video game from the total money they have to calculate how many dollars they have left.
money_left = total_money - money_spent

answer = money_left


Q: Each eraser regardless of brand cost c0. Alice bought c1 erasers from brand A and c2 earsers from brand B. How many dollars did she spend? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

eraser_cost = c0
eraser_A = c1
eraser_B = c2

1. Sum up the number of erasers since each eraser cost the same regardless of brand. Let total_eraser be the total number of eraser they have,
total_eraser = eraser_A + eraser_B

2. Multiply the total number of erasers by the cost of each eraser to calculate how many dollars she spent.
money_spent = total_eraser * eraser_cost

answer = money_spent
