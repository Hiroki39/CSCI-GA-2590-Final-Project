#Q: There are c0 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be c1 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
#A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1):
    #there are originally c0 trees
    trees_before = c0

    #after grove workers plant some trees today. there are c1 trees
    trees_after = c1

    #The number of trees they planted can be calculated by subtracting the orginal number of trees from the number of trees afterward
    planted = trees_after - trees_before

    return planted



#Q: If there are c0 cars in the parking lot and c1 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
#A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1):
    #there are originally c0 cars in the parking lot
    cars_before = c0

    #there are c1 cars arrives at the parking lot
    arrived = c1

    #The number of cars right now at the parking lot can be calculated by adding the number of cars arrived by the original number of cars
    cars_after = cars_before + arrived

    return cars_after
