Q: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers
is?
Answer Choices: (a) 50 (b) 45 (c) 65 (d) 78 (e) 64
A: If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be
50. The answer is a.

Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.
Answer Choices: (a) 1/2 (b) 3/2 (c) 5/2 (d) 4/2 (e) 7/2
A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3
= 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is b.
