Q: Andy and his brother Aaron received money for holiday. Andy had c0 dollars while his brother had c1. If they spent c2 dollars on a new video game, how many dollars do they have left? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Andy has c0 dollars
    andy = c0

    # Andy's brother has c1 dollars
    brother = c1

    # They together has c0+c1 dollars in total
    total = andy + brother

    # They spend c2 on a video game
    video_game = c2

    # The money the have left in total can be calculated now as the money in total minus the price of video game
    left = total - video_game

    return left


Q: Each eraser regardless of brand cost c0. Alice bought c1 erasers from brand A and c2 erasers from brand B. How many dollars did she spend? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Each eraser costs c0
    eraser = c0

    # Alice bought c1 erasers from brand A and c2 erasers from brand B, so she bought c1 plus c2 erasers in total
    total = c1 + c2

    # Thus, alice must have spent 'Money * total' in total
    spent = eraser * total

    return spent
