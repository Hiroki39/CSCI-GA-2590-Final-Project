Q: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers
is?
Answer Choices: (a) 50 (b) 45 (c) 65 (d) 78 (e) 64
A: mapping:{x:the mean of the numbers if 10 is added to each number}
If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. 
Eq1: x=40+10
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,40+10)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 50 from Sympy, so the answer is a.
