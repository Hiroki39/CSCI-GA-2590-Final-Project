Q: Andy and his brother Aaron received money for holiday. Andy had c0 dollars while his brother had c1. If they spent c2 dollars on a new video game, how many dollars do they have left? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Andy has c0 dollars
    andy = c0

    # Andy's brother has c1 dollars
    brother = c1

    # They together has c0+c1 dollars in total
    total = andy + brother

    # They spend c2 on a video game
    video_game = c2

    # The money the have left in total can be calculated now as the money in total minus the price of video game
    left = total - video_game

    return left


Q: Each eraser regardless of brand cost c0. Alice bought c1 erasers from brand A and c2 erasers from brand B. How many dollars did she spend? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Each eraser costs c0
    eraser = c0

    # Alice bought c1 erasers from brand A and c2 erasers from brand B, so she bought c1 plus c2 erasers in total
    total = c1 + c2

    # Thus, alice must have spent 'Money * total' in total
    spent = eraser * total

    return spent


Q: A comittee has c0 females and c1 males. If they were split into sub-comittee of size c2 how many sub-comittees could they make? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Solve the problem step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # The committee has c0 females
    female = c0

    # The comittee has c1 males
    male = c1

    # The total number of people of the committee can be calculated by adding the number of male and the number of female
    total = female + male

    # Now the committee will be split into sub-committees each of which is sized c2
    size = c2

    # Now the number of committees can be calcullated by dividing the total number of people of the original committee by the number of people of each sub-committee
    num_subcommittees = total / size

    return num_subcommittees


Q: A construction team has already completed c0 meters of a bridge that needs to be c1 meter long. Assuming each meter requries c2 minutes to complete, how many minutes do they have left? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Solve the problem step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # The construction team has finished c0 meters of the bridge
    finished = c0

    # The bridge needs to be c1 meters long
    bridge_length = c1

    # Now the left part to be finished is calculated by the total length minus the length of the finished part
    length_remain = finished - bridge_length

    # Each meters requires c2 minutes to complete
    minutes_per_meter  = c2

    # The total minute requires to finish the bridge can be calculated by multiplying the total meters left with the number of minutes to finish one meter
    minutes_remaining = length_remain * minutes_per_meter

    return minutes_remaining


Q: Tom has c0 tickets to spend in an amusement park. He has already spent c1 tickets on food. Assuming each soda cost c2 tickets, how many sodas could Tom exchange with tickets? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Solve the problem step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Tom has c0 tickets to spend during the time at the amusement park
    total_tickets = c0

    # Tom has already spent c1 tickets on food
    tickets_spent = c1

    # The remaining tickets tom has can be calculated as total number of tickets minus the number of tickets he has spent
    tickets_left = c0 - tickets_spent

    # Each soda cost c2 tickets
    soda_cost = c2

    # The number of soda Tom could buy the the remaining ticket can be calculated by dividing the number of remaining tickets with the cost of each soda
    num_soda = tickets_left / soda_cost

    return num_soda


Q: Haley is packing gifts for holiday. She has c0 post cards from New York and c1 postcards from California. Each envelope can contain c2 postcards each. How many envelopes does Haley need to store all the postcards? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Solve the problem step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Haley has c0 post cards from New York
    NY_postcards = c0

    # Haley has c1 post cards from California
    CA_postcards = c1

    # So haley has total number of cards as that from NYC plus that from California
    total_cards = NY_postcards + CA_postcards

    # Each envelop can store c2 cards
    postcards_per_envelope = c2

    # Divide the number of total postcards by number of postcards per envelop to calculate how many envelopes she needs.
    total_envelopes = total_cards / postcards_per_envelope

    return total_envelopes


Q: Charlotte got c0 marks for each correct questions. There are c1 questions on the exam, and she got c2 questions wrong. How many marks did she get? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Solve the problem step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Charlotte got c0 marks for each correct questions
    marks_per_questions = c0

    # There are c1 questions on the exam
    total_questions = c1

    # Charlotte got c2 questions wrong
    wrong_questions = c2

    # Subtract the number of wrong questions from the total number of questions to calculate the number of correct questions.
    correct_questions = total_questions - wrong_questions

    # Multiply the number of correct questions by the marks per question to calculate the final mark.
    total_marks = correct_questions * marks_per_questions

    return total_marks


Q: Amy had c0 cups. She put c1 of them in one large cabinet, and she wants to put the rest in c2 cabinets that are the same. How many cups will there be in a single cabinet? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Solve the problem step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Amy has c0 cups
    total_cups = c0

    # Amy put c1 cups in a large cabinet
    cups_large_cabinets = c1

    # She wants to put the rest in c2 cabinets that are the same
    total_other_cabinets = c2

    # Subtract the number of cups in the large cabinet from the total number of cups to calculate the number of cups left to be put in other cabinets.
    cups_left = total_cups - cups_large_cabinets

    # Divide the number of cups left by the number of cabinet to calculate the number of cups in each cabinet that is not the first one.
    cups_per_cabinet = cups_left / total_other_cabinets

    return cups_per_cabinet
