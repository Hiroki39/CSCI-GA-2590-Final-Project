Q: Andy and his brother Aaron received money for holiday. Andy had c0 dollars while his brother had c1. If they spent c2 dollars on a new video game, how many dollars do they have left? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Andy has c0 dollars
    andy = c0

    # Andy's brother has c1 dollars
    brother = c1

    # They together has c0+c1 dollars in total
    total = andy + brother

    # They spend c2 on a video game
    video_game = c2

    # The money the have left in total can be calculated now as the money in total minus the price of video game
    left = total - video_game

    return left


Q: Each eraser regardless of brand cost c0. Alice bought c1 erasers from brand A and c2 erasers from brand B. How many dollars did she spend? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Each eraser costs c0
    eraser = c0

    # Alice bought c1 erasers from brand A and c2 erasers from brand B, so she bought c1 plus c2 erasers in total
    total = c1 + c2

    # Thus, alice must have spent 'Money * total' in total
    spent = eraser * total

    return spent


Q: A comittee has c0 females and c1 males. If they were split into sub-comittee of size c2 how many sub-comittees could they make? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Solve the problem step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # The committee has c0 females
    female = c0

    # The comittee has c1 males
    male = c1

    # The total number of people of the committee can be calculated by adding the number of male and the number of female
    total = female + male

    # Now the committee will be split into sub-committees each of which is sized c2
    size = c2

    # Now the number of committees can be calcullated by dividing the total number of people of the original committee by the number of people of each sub-committee
    num_subcommittees = total / size

    return num_subcommittees


Q: A construction team has already completed c0 meters of a bridge that needs to be c1 meter long. Assuming each meter requries c2 minutes to complete, how many minutes do they have left? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Solve the problem step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # The construction team has finished c0 meters of the bridge
    finished = c0

    # The bridge needs to be c1 meters long
    bridge_length = c1

    # Now the left part to be finished is calculated by the total length minus the length of the finished part
    length_remain = finished - bridge_length

    # Each meters requires c2 minutes to complete
    minutes_per_meter  = c2

    # The total minute requires to finish the bridge can be calculated by multiplying the total meters left with the number of minutes to finish one meter
    minutes_remaining = length_remain * minutes_per_meter

    return minutes_remaining
