Q: There are c0 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be c1 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1):
    # There are originally c0 trees
    trees_before = c0

    # After grove workers plant some trees today. there are c1 trees
    trees_after = c1

    # The number of trees they planted can be calculated by subtracting the orginal number of trees from the number of trees afterward
    planted = trees_after - trees_before

    return planted

Q: If there are c0 cars in the parking lot and c1 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1):
    # There are originally c0 cars in the parking lot
    cars_before = c0

    # There are c1 cars arrives at the parking lot
    arrived = c1

    # The number of cars right now at the parking lot can be calculated by adding the number of cars arrived by the original number of cars
    cars_after = cars_before + arrived

    return cars_after

Q: Leah had c0 chocolates and her sister had c1. If they ate c2, how many pieces do they have left in total? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Leah had c0 chocolates
    leah = c0

    # Leah's sister had c1 chocolates
    sister = c1

    # They together have c0 plus c1 chocolate in total
    total_before = leah + sister

    # They ate c2 chocolates
    ate = c2

    # The number of chocolates they have left in total right now can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolates they ate from the orginal number of chocolates they had in total
    total_now = total_before - ate

    return total_now

Q: Jason had c0 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has c1 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1):
    # Jason originally had c0 lollipops
    jason_original = c0

    # After Jason gave Denny some lollipops,he now has c1 lollipops
    jason_now = c1

    # The number of lollipops Jason gave to Denny can be calculated by substracting the number of lollipops Jason has now from the original number of lollipops Jason had.
    gave = jason_original - jason_now

    return gave
