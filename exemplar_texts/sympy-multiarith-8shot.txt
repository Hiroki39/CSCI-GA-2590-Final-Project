Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there
will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
A: mapping:{x: treethe grove workers plant today}
There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. 
Eq1: 21-15=x
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,21-15)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 6 from sympy, so the answer is 6.

Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?
A: mapping:{x: cars in the parking lot}
There are originally 3 cars. 2 more cars arrive.
Eq1: x=3+2
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,3+2)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 5 from sympy, so the answer is 5.

Q: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf
balls did he have at the end of wednesday?
A: mapping: {x: golf balls he have at the end of wednesday}
Michael started with 58 golf balls, lost 23 on tuesday, and then lost 2 more
Eq1: x=58-23-2
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,58-23-2)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 33 from sympy, so the answer is 33.

Q: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
A: mapping:{x:money she have left}
Olivia had 23 dollars. 5 bagels for 3 dollars each will be 5 x 3
Eq1: 23-5*3=x  
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,23-5*3)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 8 from sympy, so the answer is 8.

Q: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday
to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?
A: mapping:{x:computers now in the server room}
There were originally 9 computers. For each of 4 days, 5 more computers were added. So 5 * 4 
computers were added. 
Eq1: 9+5*4=x  
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(9+5*4,x)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 29 from sympy, so the answer is 29.

Q: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he
have now?
A: mapping:{x: toys Shawn has now}
Shawn started with 5 toys. If he got 2 toys each from his mom and dad, then that is 2+2 more toys.
Eq1: 5+2+2=x  
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(5+2+2,x)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 9 from sympy, so the answer is 9.

Q: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did
Jason give to Denny?
A: mapping:{x: lollipops Jason give to Denny}
Jason started with 20 lollipops. Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny. So he gave Denny 20 - 12 lollipops
Eq1: 20-12=x  
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(20-12, x)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 8 from sympy, so the answer is 8.

Q: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?
A: mapping:{x:pieces left in total} 
Originally, Leah had 32 chocolates. Her sister had 42. So in total they had 32 + 42. After eating 35, they
had 32 + 42 - 35. 
Eq1: x=32 + 42 - 35 
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,32 + 42 - 35)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 39 from sympy, so the answer is 39.
