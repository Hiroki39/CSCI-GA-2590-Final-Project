Q: Andy and his brother Aaron received money for holiday. Andy had 8 dollars while his brother had 10. If they spent 12 dollars on a new video game, how many dollars do they have left?
A: Andy had 8 dollars. Aaron had 10 dollars. They have 8 + 10 = 18 dollars in total. They spent 12 dollars on the new video game. So the money they have left is 18 - 12 = 6. The answer is 6.
