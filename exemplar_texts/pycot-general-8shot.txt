Q: There are c0 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be c1 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1):
    # There are originally c0 trees
    trees_before = c0

    # After grove workers plant some trees today. there are c1 trees
    trees_after = c1

    # The number of trees they planted can be calculated by subtracting the orginal number of trees from the number of trees afterward
    planted = trees_after - trees_before

    return planted

Q: If there are c0 cars in the parking lot and c1 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1):
    # There are originally c0 cars in the parking lot
    cars_before = c0

    # There are c1 cars arrives at the parking lot
    arrived = c1

    # The number of cars right now at the parking lot can be calculated by adding the number of cars arrived by the original number of cars
    cars_after = cars_before + arrived

    return cars_after

Q: Leah had c0 chocolates and her sister had c1. If they ate c2, how many pieces do they have left in total? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Leah had c0 chocolates
    leah = c0

    # Leah's sister had c1 chocolates
    sister = c1

    # They together have c0 plus c1 chocolate in total
    total_before = leah + sister

    # They ate c2 chocolates
    ate = c2

    # The number of chocolates they have left in total right now can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolates they ate from the orginal number of chocolates they had in total
    total_now = total_before - ate

    return total_now

Q: Jason had c0 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has c1 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1):
    # Jason originally had c0 lollipops
    jason_original = c0

    # After Jason gave Denny some lollipops,he now has c1 lollipops
    jason_now = c1

    # The number of lollipops Jason gave to Denny can be calculated by substracting the number of lollipops Jason has now from the original number of lollipops Jason had.
    gave = jason_original - jason_now

    return gave

Q: Shawn has c0 toys. For Christmas, he got c1 toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1):
    # Shawn orginally had c0 toys
    shawn_original = c0

    # Shawn received c1 new toys on Chrismas from his mom and dad
    new = c1

    # The number of toys Shawn has now can be calculated by adding the number of new toys he received to the number of toys he originally had
    shawn_now = shawn_original + new

    return shawn_now

Q: There were c0 computers in the server room. c1 more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1):
    # There were originally c0 computers in the server room
    computer_original = c0

    # In each day from monday to thursday, c1 new computers were installed
    new = c1

    # From mmonday to friday, there are 4 days in total when there were new computers to be installed
    days = 4

    # The total number of new computers installed can be calculated by multiplying the number of days by the number of computers installed each day.
    total_new = new * days

    # The number of computers right now can be calculated by adding the original number of computer by the number of new computers installed.
    computer_now = computer_original + total_new

    return computer_now

Q: Michael had c0 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost c1 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost c2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Michael originally had c0 golf balls
    golf_original = c0

    # Michael lost c1 golf balls on Tuesday
    lost_tudeday = c1

    # Micheal lost c2 golf balls on Wednesday
    lost_wednesday = c2

    # The total number of golf balls Micheal lost can be calculated by adding the number of golf balls he lost on Tuesday by the bumber of golf balls he lost on Wednesday
    total_lost  = lost_tudeday + lost_wednesday

    # The number of golf balls Michael now has can be calculated by substracting the number of balls he lost by the number of balls he had originally.
    golf_now = golf_original - total_lost

    return golf_now

Q: Olivia has c0 dollars. She bought c1 bagels for c2 dollars each. How much money does she have left? Write a python program to calculate the answer step by step.
A: Let's think about it step by step:
def Problem(c0, c1, c2):
    # Olivia had c0 dollars originally
    money_before = c0

    # Olivia bought c1 bagels
    bagels = c1

    # Each bagels cost c2 dollars
    price = c2

    # The totall cost of the bagels Olivia bought can be calculated by multiplying the number of bagels she bought by the price of each bagels
    total_cost = bagels * price
    
    # The total money Olivia has right now can be calculated by substracting the total cost of bagels from the orginal money she had
    money_now = money_before - total_cost

    return money_now
