Q: Andy and his brother Aaron received money for holiday. Andy had c0 dollars while his brother had c1. If they spent c2 dollars on a new video game, how many dollars do they have left? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

andy_money = c0
aaron_money = c1
money_spent = c2

1. Sum up their money since they spent money on a new video game together. Let total_money be the total number of dollars they have,
total_money = andy_money + aaron_money

2. Subtract the money spent by them on video game from the total money they have to calculate how many dollars they have left.
money_left = total_money - money_spent

answer = money_left


Q: Each eraser regardless of brand cost c0. Alice bought c1 erasers from brand A and c2 earsers from brand B. How many dollars did she spend? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

eraser_cost = c0
eraser_A = c1
eraser_B = c2

1. Sum up the number of erasers since each eraser cost the same regardless of brand. Let total_eraser be the total number of eraser they have,
total_eraser = eraser_A + eraser_B

2. Multiply the total number of erasers by the cost of each eraser to calculate how many dollars she spent.
money_spent = total_eraser * eraser_cost

answer = money_spent


Q: A comittee has c0 females and c1 males. If they were split into sub-comittee of size c2 how many sub-comittees could they make? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

females = c0
males = c1
size = c2

1. Sum up the total number of people first in order to further split them. Let total_people be the total number of people,
total_people = females + males

2. Divide the total number of people by number of people per sub-comittee to calculate the number of sub-comittees.
num_subcomittees = total_people / size

answer = num_subcomittees


Q: A construction team has already completed c0 meters of a bridge that needs to be c1 meter long. Assuming each meter requries c2 minutes to complete, how many minutes do they have left? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

completed_meter = c0
total_meter = c1
minutes_per_meter = c2

1. Subtract the length of bridge that has been completed from the total length of bridge to find the length of the remaing, not completed portion. Let length_remain be the length of remaining bridge,
length_remain = total_meter - completed_meter

2. Multiply the minutes needed to complete each meter by the length of the remaining bridge in meter to calculate the time remaining.
minutes_remaining = length_remain * minutes_per_meter 

answer = minutes_remaining
