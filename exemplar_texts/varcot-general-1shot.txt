Q: There are c0 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be c1 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
A: There are c0 trees originally. Then there were c1 trees after some more were planted. So there must have been c1 - c0 new trees. 
new_trees = c1 - c0
