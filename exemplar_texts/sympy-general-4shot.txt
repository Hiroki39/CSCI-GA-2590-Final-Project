Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there
will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
A: mapping:{x: treethe grove workers plant today}
There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. 
Eq1: 21-15=x
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,21-15)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 6 from sympy, so the answer is 6.

Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?
A: mapping:{x: cars in the parking lot}
There are originally 3 cars. 2 more cars arrive.
Eq1: x=3+2
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,3+2)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 5 from sympy, so the answer is 5.

Q: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf
balls did he have at the end of wednesday?
A: mapping: {x: golf balls he have at the end of wednesday}
Michael started with 58 golf balls, lost 23 on tuesday, and then lost 2 more
Eq1: x=58-23-2
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,58-23-2)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 33 from sympy, so the answer is 33.

Q: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
A: mapping:{x:money she have left}
Olivia had 23 dollars. 5 bagels for 3 dollars each will be 5 x 3
Eq1: 23-5*3=x  
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,23-5*3)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
We got 8 from sympy, so the answer is 8.
