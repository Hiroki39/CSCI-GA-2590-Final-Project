Q: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
A: mapping:{x:money she have left}
Olivia had 23 dollars. 5 bagels for 3 dollars each will be 5 x 3
Eq1: 23-5*3=x  
# using Python Sympy to solve for unknowns
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
Eq1 = Eq(x,23-5*3)
print(solve(Eq1,x))
