Q: Natalia sold clips to c0 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def clips_sold(c0, c1, c2):

    # there are c0 clips sold in April
    april = c0
    # compute the number of clips sold in May
    may = april // 2
    # compute the total number of clips sold in April and May
    total = april + may
    # return the answer
    return total
