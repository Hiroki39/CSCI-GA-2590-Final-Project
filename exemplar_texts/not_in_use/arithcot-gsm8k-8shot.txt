Q: Natalia sold clips to c0 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Divide the number of clips sold in April by 2 to find the number of clips sold in May. Let x be the number of clips sold in May,
x = c0 / 2

2. Add the number of clips sold in April (c0) and May (c1) to get the number of clips sold altogether.
answer = c0 + x


Q: Weng earns $c0 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did c1 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Divide the number of minutes spent babysitting by 60 to get the number of hours. Let x be the number of hours spent babysitting. 
x = c1 / 60

2. Multiply the number of hours spent babysitting and rate to get the total pay.
answer = x * c0


Q: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $c0. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $c1 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Divide the cost of the wallet by 2 to find the amount of money Betty currently has. Let x be the amount of money that she currently has,
x = c0 / 2

2. Add the money from her parents to the money she has from herself. Let y be the amount of money that she has after her parents give her money,
y = x + c1

3. Multiply the amount of money from her parents by 2 to find the amount of money from her grandparents. Let z be the amount of money given to Betty from her grandparents,
z = c1 * 2

4. Add the money from her grandparents to her current amount of money. Let w be the amount of money that she has in total,
w = y + z

5. Subtract the amount of money Betty now has to calculate how much she still needs.
answer = c0 - w


Q: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read c0 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Multiply the number of pages read yesterday by 2 to calculate the number of pages she read today. Let x be the number of pages she read today,
x = c0 * 2

2. Subtract the number of pages she read today and yesterday from the total number of pages to get the remaining. Let y be the number of pages remaining,
y = 120 - x - c1

3. Divide the remaining pages by 2 to calculate the number of pages she need to read tomorrow.
answer = y/2


Q: James writes a 3-page letter to c0 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Multiply the number of pages per letter with number of friends to get the number of pages worte every time. Let x be the number of letters wrote every time,
x = 3 * c0

2. Multiply the number of pages wrote every time by 2 to get the number of pages wrote every week. Let x be the number of letters wrote every week,
y = x * 2

3. Multiply the number of pages wrote every week by the number of weeks per year (52) to get the total number of pages he writes a year.
answer = 52 * y


Q: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are c0% more of those in purple. There are only c1% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Multiply the number of yellow flowers by percentage of additional purple flowers to get the number of additional purple flowers. Let x be the number of additional purple flowers,
x = 10 * c0 / 100

2. Add the number of additional purple flowers to the number of yellow flowers to get the total number of purple flowers. Let y be the total number of purple flowers,
y = 10 + x

3. Add the number of yellow flowers and purple flowers to get the total number of yellow and purple flowers. Let z be the total number of yellow and purple flowers,
z = 10 + y

4. Multiply the number of yellow and purple flowers by percentage of green flowers with respect to yellow and purple flowers to get the number of green flowers. Let w be the number of green flowers,
w = z * c1 / 100

5. Add the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers to get the answer.
answer = 10 + y + w


Q: Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys c0 large pizzas and c1 small pizzas. A large pizza has c2 slices and a small pizza has c3 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Multiply the number of large pizza with the number of slices per large pizza to get the total number of slices from large pizza. Let x be the total number of slices from large pizza,
x = c0 * c2

2. Multiply the number of small pizza with the number of slices per small pizza to get the total number of slices from small pizzas. Let y be the total number of slices from small pizzas,
y = c1 * c3

3. Add the number of total number of slices from large pizzas and total number of slices from small pizzas to get the answer.
answer = x + y


Q: Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school. Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to c0 pounds. Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Next, he added another c1 pounds of jelly beans. And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Multiply the weight of old jelly bean by 3 to get the weight of jelly beans and brownies. Let x be the weight of old jelly beans and brownies,
x = c0 * 3

2. Add the weight of new jelly beans to the weight of old jelly beans and brownies. Let the y be the weight of all jelly beans and brownies,
y = x + c1

3. Multiply the weight of all jelly beans and brownies by 2 to get the weight of all jelly beans, brownies, and gummy worms to get the answer.
answer = y * 2
