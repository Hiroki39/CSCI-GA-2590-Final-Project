Q: Natalia sold clips to c0 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def clips_sold(c0):

    # there are c0 clips sold in April
    april = c0
    # compute the number of clips sold in May
    may = april / 2
    # compute the total number of clips sold in April and May
    total = april + may
    # return the answer
    return total


Q: Weng earns $c0 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did c1 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def babysitting_pay(c0, c1):

    # the pay for babysitting is $c0 an hour
    rate = c0
    # there are c1 minutes of babysitting
    minutes = c1
    # compute the number of hours of babysitting
    hours = minutes / 60
    # compute Weng's total pay
    pay = rate * hours
    # return the answer
    return pay


Q: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $c0. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $c1 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def money_required(c0, c1):

    # the wallet costs $c0
    wallet = c0
    # Betty has half of the money she needs
    half = wallet / 2
    # her parents give her $c1
    parents = c1
    # her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents
    grandparents = parents * 2
    # compute the total amount of money Betty has
    total = half + parents + grandparents
    # compute the amount of money Betty still needs
    need = wallet - total
    # return the answer
    return need


Q: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read c0 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def pages_to_read(c0):

    # there are 120 pages in the book
    book = 120
    # yesterday, Julie read c0 pages
    yesterday = c0
    # today, Julie read twice as many pages as yesterday
    today = yesterday * 2
    # compute the number of pages left to read
    remaining = book - today - yesterday
    # tomorrow, Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages
    tomorrow = remaining / 2
    # return the answer
    return tomorrow
