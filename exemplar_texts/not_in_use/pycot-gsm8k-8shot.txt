Q: Natalia sold clips to c0 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def Problem(c0):

    # there are c0 clips sold in April
    april = c0
    # compute the number of clips sold in May, which is half of that in April
    may = april / 2
    # compute the total number of clips sold in April and May
    total = april + may
    # return the answer
    return total


Q: Weng earns c0 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did c1 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def Problem(c0, c1):

    # the pay for babysitting is c0 an hour
    rate = c0
    # there are c1 minutes of babysitting
    minutes = c1
    # 1 hour equals to 60 minutes; compute the number of hours of babysitting
    hours = minutes / 60
    # compute Weng's total pay
    pay = rate * hours
    # return the answer
    return pay


Q: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs c0. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her c1 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def Problem(c0, c1):

    # the wallet costs $c0
    wallet = c0
    # Betty has half of the money she needs
    half = wallet / 2
    # her parents give her $c1
    parents = c1
    # her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents
    grandparents = parents * 2
    # compute the total amount of money Betty has now
    total = half + parents + grandparents
    # compute the amount of money Betty still needs to buy wallet
    need = wallet - total
    # return the answer
    return need


Q: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read c0 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def Problem(c0):

    # there are 120 pages in the book
    book = 120
    # yesterday, Julie read c0 pages
    yesterday = c0
    # today, Julie read twice as many pages as yesterday
    today = yesterday * 2
    # compute the number of pages left to read
    remaining = book - today - yesterday
    # tomorrow, Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages
    tomorrow = remaining / 2
    # return the answer
    return tomorrow


Q: James writes a 3-page letter to c0 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def Problem(c0):

    # there are 3 pages in the letter
    pages = 3
    # James writes the letter to c0 different friends
    friends = c0
    # There are 52 weeks in a year
    weeks = 52
    # James writes the letter to every friend twice a week
    freq = 2
    # compute the number of pages James writes a year
    pages_year = pages * friends * weeks * freq
    # return the answer
    return pages_year


Q: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are c0% more of those in purple. There are only c1% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def Problem(c0, c1):

    # there are 10 yellow flowers
    yellow = 10
    # there are c0% more purple flowers than yellow flowers
    purple = yellow * (1 + c0 / 100)
    # there are c1% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers
    green = (yellow + purple) * (c1 / 100)
    # compute the total number of flowers
    total = yellow + purple + green
    # return the answer
    return total


Q: Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys c0 large pizzas and c1 small pizzas. A large pizza has c2 slices and a small pizza has c3 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def Problem(c0, c1, c2, c3):

    # there are c0 large pizzas
    large = c0
    # there are c1 small pizzas
    small = c1
    # a large pizza has c2 slices
    large_slices = c2
    # a small pizza has c3 slices
    small_slices = c3
    # compute the total number of slices in the large pizzas
    large_total = large * large_slices
    # compute the total number of slices in the small pizzas
    small_total = small * small_slices
    # compute the total number of slices
    total = large_total + small_total
    # return the answer
    return total


Q: Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school. Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to c0 pounds. Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Next, he added another c1 pounds of jelly beans. And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds? Write a Python function that returns the answer.

A:
# solve the problem step by step
def Problem(c0, c1):

    # Ken poured enough jelly beans to bring the weight to c0 pounds
    box = c0
    # Ken added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple
    box = box * 3
    # Ken added another c1 pounds of jelly beans
    box = box + c1
    # Ken added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again
    box = box * 2
    # return the answer
    return box
