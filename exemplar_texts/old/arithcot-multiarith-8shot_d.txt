Q: For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had c0 pieces of candy while her sister had c1. If they ate c2 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Add the pieces of candy from Debby and her sister to calculate the total pieces of candy. Let x be the total pieces of candy,
x = c0 + c1

2. Subtract the piece of candy ate by them from the total pieces of candy to calculate the answer.
answer = x - c2


Q: At the town carnival Billy rode the ferris wheel c0 times and the bumper cars c1 times. If each ride cost c2 tickets, how many tickets did he use? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Add the number of ferries wheel ride and the number of bumper cars ride to calculate the total number of rides. Let x be the total number of rides,
x = c0 + c1

2. Multiply the number of tickets by the cost each ride to calculate the answer.
answer = x * c2


Q: The schools debate team had c0 boys and c1 girls on it. If they were split into groups of c2 how many groups could they make? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Add the number of boys and the number of girls to calculate the total number of students. Let x be the total number of students,
x = c0 + c1

2. Divide the number of total students by number of students per group to calculate the answer.
answer = x / c2


Q: A new building needed c0 windows. The builder had already installed c1 of them. If it takes c2 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Subtract the number of total windows needed and the number of windows completed to calculate the number of windows that need to be installed. Let x be the number of windows that need to be installed,
x = c0 - c1

2. Multiply the hours needed to install each window by the number of windows left to calculate the answer.
answer = x * c2


Q: Will had c0 dollars. If he spent c1 bucks on a new game, how many c2 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Subtract the number of money spent on a new game from the total amount of money to calculate the money he had left. Let x be the money he had left,
x = c0 - c1

2. Divide the money he had left by the price per toy to calculate the answer.
answer = x / c2


Q: Luke was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with c0 on each page. If he had c1 new cards and c2 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Add the number of new cards and the number of old cards to calculate the total number of cards. Let x be the total number of cards,
x = c1 + c2

2. Divide the number of total pages by number of cards per page to calculate the answer.
answer = x / c0


Q: Bianca earned c0 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had c1 bags, but didn't recycle c2 of them, how many points would she have earned? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Subtract the number of bags not recycled from the total number of bags to calculate the number of bags recycled. Let x be the number of bags recycled,
x = c1 - c2

2. Multiply the number of bags recycled by the points per recycled bag to calculate the answer.
answer = x * c0


Q: Will had c0 pieces of clothing to wash. He put c1 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into c2 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Subtract the number of clothing in one load from the total number of clothing to wash to calculate the number of clothing to be split. Let x be the number of clothing to be split,
x = c0 - c1

2. Divide the clothing to be split by the number of loads to calculate the answer.
answer = x / c2
