Q: For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had c0 pieces of candy while her sister had c1. If they ate c2 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Add the pieces of candy from Debby and her sister to calculate the total pieces of candy. Let x be the total pieces of candy,
x = c0 + c1

2. Subtract the piece of candy ate by them from the total pieces of candy to calculate the answer.
answer = x - c2
